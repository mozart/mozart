<Chapter id="chapter.widgets-2">
  <Title/More Widgets/

  <P>
    This chapters presents widgets which are intended to be interactive:
    buttons to invoke actions, entries to enter text, scales to enter
    numbers, and listboxes to choose elements of lists.

  <Section id="section.widgets-2.button">
    <Title/Buttons and Actions/

    <P>
    <para class=apropos><title/actions/
      <def/Button/ widgets are similar to label widgets: they display text,
      bitmaps, or images.  Additionally, they provide for <Def/actions/:
      pressing the mouse button over the button widget, invokes an
      action.  An action is either a procedure or a pair of object and
      message.  If the action is a procedure, pressing the widget button
      creates a thread in which the procedure is applied.  Otherwise,
      a thread is created that applies the
      object to the message provided. Actions are discussed in more
      detail in <Ptr to="section.widgets-2.action">.

    <P>
      <Ptr to="figure.widgets-2.buttons"> shows a program which creates two
      buttons and attaches actions to them. Pressing button <<B1>> browses
      the atom <<pressed>>, whereas pressing button <<B2>> closes the toplevel
      widget object&nbsp;<<T>>.

    <para class=apropos><title/action values/
      The <<action>> option is different from other options in
      that it has not a generic translation as explained in <Ptr
      to="section.widgets-1.tickles">.  Valid values for this option
      are not tickles, but as already mentioned, procedures or object
      message pairs.

    <P>
      Internally, an object providing for the <<action>> option, creates a Tcl
      script which when executed invokes the &Oz; procedure or object.  This
      script is used then as value for the configuration option <<command>>.
      All widgets which provide for the <<command>> option in Tk, provide for
      the <<action>> option in &Oz;.

    <para class=apropos><title/changing actions/
      Actions can be deleted or changed by the method <<tkAction>>.  For
      example, deleting the action for button <<B1>> and changing the action
      for <<B2>> can be done by executing:
<chunk class=anonymous><title/button action/
{B1 tkAction}
{B2 tkAction(action: B1 # tkClose)}

  <Section id="section.widgets-2.otherbuttons">
    <Title/Checkbuttons, Radiobuttons, and Variables/

    <para class=apropos><title/checkbuttons/
      Checkbutton widgets are used for binary choices.  An indicator to the
      left shows whether the button is <Q/on/ or <Q/off/.  The state of the
      indicator is given by a tickle variable. A tickle variable is a tickle
      object that provides messages to set and to query the value of the
      variable. 

    <para class=apropos><title/radiobuttons/
      Radiobuttons are used for non-binary choices.  Several radiobuttons
      are linked together to a group. Selecting a radio button de-selects all
      buttons belonging to the same group and displays a mark in an indicator
      to the left.  Radiobuttons are linked together by tickle variables: all
      buttons belonging to the same group share the same variable.

    <P>
      <Ptr to="figure.widgets-2.check-and-radio"> shows an example of a
      checkbutton and a group of three radiobuttons.  The value with which
      the variable <<V1>> is initialized determines whether the checkbutton
      initially is selected.  The value of the variable <<V2>> determines
      which of the radiobuttons is selected initially.

    <para class=apropos><title/actions/
      Very often selecting a checkbutton or a radiobutton must show

      to checkbuttons and radiobuttons in the same way as for buttons.

  <Section id="section.widgets-2.return">
    <Title/Querying Tickle Objects/

    <P>
      In the previous section we queried a Tk-variable's state with the
      methods <<tkReturnInt>> and <<tkReturnAtom>>.  In fact it is possible to
      query the state of all tickle objects, in particular to query the state
      of widgets.

    <P>
      All tickle objects provide a method <<tkReturn>>.  This method is
      similar to the <<tk>> method in that it sends a message to the graphics
      engine.  After the message has been executed by the graphics
      engine, however, the <<tkReturn>> method returns a string,
      whereas the <<tk>> method 
      ignores this string.

    <para class=apropos><title/synchronization/
      The field of the <<tkReturn>> message with the largest integer
      feature is constrained to the string returned.  The method
      <<tkReturn>> is asynchronous: it sends the message to the
      graphics engine but does not block the thread until the return
      string is available.  Eventually the graphics engine writes the
      return string to the store.
   
    <p>
      The <<tkReturn>> message is sent
      asynchronously for efficiency reasons. One
      can start another calculation without having to
      wait for <<tkReturn>>'s result.  One can
      send several <<tkReturn>> messages consecutively, and
      they will be sent immediately. The messages
      will be handled by the graphics agent in the
      same order as they are sent. 

    <p>
      If you want to be sure that you have
      received the return value, say <<X>>, 
      of <<tkReturn>> before continuing, then you must use a <<{Wait X}>>
      statement.

    <para class=apropos><title/illegal return values/
      Similar to the method <<tkReturn>> tickle objects provide methods that
      return atoms, integers, floats and lists of strings, atoms, integers,
      and floats.  Rather than writing a string to the store they write a
      value to the store which is obtained by transforming the string to the
      particular type.  If it is not possible to transform the string into a
      value of that type, the boolean value <<false>> is written to the store.

    <P>
      The methods that return a list of strings, atoms, integers, or
      floats split the string into substrings separated by space characters.
      For instance, the return string <<"a b c">> is transformed into the
      list <<[a b c]>> by the method <<tkReturnListAtom>>.  <Ptr
      to="table.widgets-2.return"> lists the return methods and how
      the methods transform strings.  Note that a string <<"1.0">> is
      transformed by <<tkReturnInt>> to the integer&nbsp;<<1>>.

    <para class=apropos><title/string handling procedures/
      The Tk Module provides also for a set of procedures that can transform
      strings into atoms, integers, floats and lists of these three types.
      With these procedures it is possible to transform return strings in
      a user defined fashion.  For more information see <ptr.extern
      to="ozdoc:system" key="section.tk.strings">.


    <SubSection>
      <Title/Querying Configuration Options/

      <P>
        The values of configuration options of a widget can be queried with the
        <<configure>> command.  Instead of giving a value to which the option
        is to be set, we give the tickle <<unit>> as value.  The tickle
        <<unit>> expands to just nothing, meaning that the value is not to
        be set but to be queried.  For example, to query the value of the
        <<bg>> option of a widget&nbsp;?_{T}, we can feed
<<<{?_{T} tkReturnListAtom(configure bg:unit $)}>>

      <P>
        This displays a list of atoms, usually it suffices to know that the
        current value of the option is the fifth element of the list, whereas
        its default value is the fourth element of the list.

    <SubSection>
      <Title/Querying Widget Parameters/

      <P>
        The command <<winfo>> is helpful to query parameters of widgets.  For
        instance, to query the position and geometry of a widget&nbsp;?_{T}, we
        can use the following:
<index class=tails/<<Tk>><and><<returnInt>>/
<<<{Browse {Map [rootx width rooty height]
         fun {$ A} 
            {Tk.returnInt winfo(A ?_{T})} 
         end}}>>>

        The <<winfo>> command provides more options than those used above,
        for the details please consult <ref.extern
        to="&tkcmd/winfo.htm"/<kbd/winfo//.


  <Section id="section.widgets-2.menu">
    <Title/Menus, Menuitems, and Menubuttons/

    <P>
      Menu widgets serve as containers for menu entries.  A menu entry can be
      one of the following:
      <Table>
        <TR/<TD/<<separator>>/<TD/displays a horizontal line//
        <TR/<TD/<<command>>/<TD/similar to button widgets//
        <TR/<TD/<<radiobutton>>/<TD/similar to radiobutton widgets//
        <TR/<TD/<<checkbutton>>/<TD/similar to checkbutton widgets//
        <TR/<TD/<<cascade>>/<TD/displays sub menus//
      </Table>
      Menu entries are not widgets.  In particular, menu entries are not
      managed by a geometry manager.  Instead as soon as a menu entry is
      created it is displayed in its parent menu.  To configure a menu entry
      after it has been created, one needs to use the <<entryconfigure>>
      command rather than the <<configure>> command.

    <para class=apropos><title/tear off entry/
      The program shown in <Ptr to="figure.widgets-2.menu"> creates two menu
      widgets <<M1>> and <<M2>>.  The first cascade entry of the menu widget
      <<M1>> is configured such that it displays the menu <<M2>> when the menu
      is traversed.  The option <<tearoff>> determines that the first default
      so-called <Q/tear off/ entry is not created.  Selecting a tear off
      entry displays the menu in a window on its own.

    <para class=apropos><title/posting menus/
      Usually menus are not visible.  Only when needed a menu appears on the
      screen, we say that it is <Def/posted/.  After the user has traversed
      the menu and has selected an entry, the menu is made invisible again: it
      is <Def/unposted/.  Posting the menu <<M1>> at the upper left edge of
      the screen can be done by
<chunk class=anonymous><title/post/
{M1 tk(post 0 0)}
</chunk>

    <para class=apropos><title/menubuttons/
      From menus one can compose menu bars and popup menus.  A menu bar
      consists of several menubutton widgets.  A menubutton widget can
      display text, bitmaps, or images.  To a menubutton a menu can be
      attached such that pressing the button makes the menu widget appear on
      the screen.  We do not discuss menu bars here in detail, since the
      <<TkTools>> module provides an abstraction that supports the creation
      of menu bars (see <ptr to="section.tools.menubars">).

    <para class=apropos><title/popup menus/
      The command <<tk_popup>> can be used to display popup menus.  It takes
      as arguments the menu widget and the coordinates where the widget should
      appear on the screen.  Ideally, we want the menu widget to appear after
      pressing the mouse button when the mouse pointer is over some widget.
      The <ref to="section.widgets-2.events"/next section/ introduces
      events which allows to mattach actions to abitrary widgets.

  <Section id="section.widgets-2.events">
    <Title/Events/

    <para class=apropos><title/binding to events/
      Button widgets allow to specify an action which is invoked when the
      button is pressed.  This is only one particular example of attaching an
      action to an event.  The Tk toolkit allows to attach actions to any
      widget with the method <<tkBind>>.  To attach an action to an event
      we refer to as <Def/binding the action to the event/.  The action is
      invoked when some event occurs.  Examples for events are to move the
      mouse pointer within a widget, or to press a mouse button when the
      mouse pointer is over a widget.  Actions can be given arguments.
      The arguments depend on the type of the event, &eg;, arguments can
      be the coordinates of the mouse pointer.

    <P>
      Let us look to the example from the previous section.  There we created
      a menu widget <<M1>> and a toplevel widget&nbsp;<<T>>.  Now we want
      that the menu widget is posted if the mouse button is pressed over the
      toplevel widget&nbsp;<<T>>.  Additionally, we want the menu to get
      posted at the position of the mouse pointer when the mouse button was
      pressed.

    <para class=apropos><title/event patterns/
      The program in <Ptr to="figure.widgets-2.event-menu"> does what we
      want: <<'&lt;Button-1&gt;'>> for the <<event>> option is
      the so-called <Def/event pattern/.  The value for the <<args>> option
      describes that the action should invoked with two arguments.  The
      first (second) one should be an integer giving the ?{x} (?{y})
      coordinate of the mouse pointer within the widget when the mouse
      button has been pressed.  The <<action>> procedure pops up the menu
      widget at exactly the screen coordinates.  These are computed from
      the coordinates of the upper left edge of the toplevel widget and the
      event arguments.

      <Title/Event Patterns/

      <P>
        An event pattern is either a string consisting of a single character,
        where the character must be different from the space character and
        <<&lt;>>.  This event pattern matches a <<KeyPress>> event for that
        character.

      <P>
        Otherwise, an event pattern must be a string
<<<'&lt;'#?_{Modifier}#'-'#?_{Modifier}#'-'#?_{Type}#'-'#?_{Detail}#'&gt;'>>>
        where only one of either ?_{Type} or ?_{Detail} is mandatory.  This
        means, for example that also
        <<<'&lt;'#?_{Type}#'&gt;'>>>
        or
        <<<'&lt;'#?_{Detail}#'&gt;'>>>
        are valid event patterns.

        For example, the event pattern

        detail means that only events from pressing or releasing this
        particular button match.  If no detail is given, pressing or
        releasing any button matches the event.  If a number is given as
        detail, <<ButtonPress>> can be omitted, &eg;, <<&lt;ButtonPress-1&gt;>>
        and <<&lt;1&gt;>> match the same events.

      <P proglang=none>
        If the event is <<KeyPress>> or <<KeyRelease>>, ?_{Detail} may be

    <SubSection>
      <Title/Invoking Actions/

      <P>
        When an event matches an event pattern to which an action has been
        bound by <<tkBind>>, a new thread is created in which the action is
        executed.  If the action is a procedure the arity of the procedure
        has to be equal to the length of the argument list specified in
        <<tkBind>>.

      <P>
        If the action is a pair of object and message, the object is applied
        to message with the arguments appended.  For example, after creating
        an event binding by
<<<{T tkBind(event:  '<1>'
          args:   [int(x)]
          action: ?_{O} # invoke(button))}>>>
        pressing the leftmost button at x-coordinate 42 creates a thread that
        executes the statement 
        <<<{?_{O} invoke(button 42)}>>>

    <SubSection>
      <Title/Appending and Deleting Event Bindings/

      <P>
        If <<tkBind>> is used as before, any other existing binding for the
        event pattern specified is overwritten.  If no action is specified any
        existing binding for the event pattern is deleted.

      <P>
        For a single event pattern there may be more than one binding.  To
        create an event binding that does not overwrite already existing
        bindings, we can give the option <<append>> with value <<true>>.
        For instance, if we do not only want to popup the menu but also to
        display <<pop>> in the Browser, we can create an additional binding by
<chunk class=anonymous><title/event append/
{W tkBind(event:  '<1>' 
          append: true
          action: proc {$} {Browse pop} end)}
</chunk>

  <Section id="section.widgets-2.action">
    <Title/More on Actions: Listeners/

    <p>
      In previous sections we used procedures or pairs of object and
      message as actions. Each time an action is invoked, a new thread
      is created. While this is fine as it comes to efficiency
      (threads in &Oz; are light weight), it may cause trouble in
      that the order in which actions are invoked might be lost: the
      threads are created in the right order but there is no guarantee
      that they will run in that order.

    <p>
      The class <<Tk.listener>> fixes this. An instance
      of a subclass of <<Tk.listener>> has a thread of its own in
      which it serves action messages in order of invocation.
      For example, in
<index class=tails/<<Tk>><and><<listener>>/
<chunk class=anonymous><title/listener/
L ={New class $ from Tk.listener
            meth b1 {Browse b1} end
            meth b2 {Browse b2} end
         end tkInit}
B1={New Tk.button tkInit(parent:W text:'One' action: L#b1)}
B2={New Tk.button tkInit(parent:W text:'Two' action: L#b2)}
{Tk.send pack(B1 B2 side:left)}
</chunk>
      the methods <<b1>> and <<b2>> are always executed in the same
      order in which the corresponding buttons are pressed.

    <p>
      When the <<tkInit>> method of the class <<Tk.listener>> is
      executed, a new thread together with a message stream is
      created.
      Whenever an action is 
      invoked, where the object ?_{O} of an object message pair
      <<?_{O}#?_{M}>> is an instance of <<Tk.listener>>, no new thread
      is created but ?_{M} is appended at the end of the message stream.
      The thread then serves the message ?_{M} as soon as all previous
      messages on the stream have been served completely. It serves
      ?_{M} by executing the object application <<{?_{O} ?_{M}}>>.

    <p>
      An additional message ?_{M} to be served can be given to a
      listener by the method <<tkServe>>. For example, by
<chunk class=anonymous><title/tkServe/
{L tkServe(b1)}
</chunk>
      the message <<b1>> is served by <<L>>.

      An entry widget lets the user enter a single line of text into the
      widget.  An example is shown in <Ptr to="figure.widgets-2.entry">.
      The initialization message for the entry widget specifies the width
      of the entry in characters.  The same holds true for the width of
      label widgets displaying text: a value for the width without an unit
      appended is taken as width in characters and not in pixels.

     <para class=apropos><title/focus/
       To be able to enter text into an entry, the entry needs to have the
       <Def/focus/.  If a widget has the focus, all input from the keyboard
       is directed to that widget. A widget that has the focus is drawn
       with a frame around it.  To give the focus to widget, we can use the
       <<focus>> command as in the above example.

     <P>
       An entry widget can be given the focus also by clicking it with the
       mouse button.  It is also possible to give the focus to button widgets.
       That allows to invoke actions with keys, and to move the focus between
       several widgets by pressing keys.  For more on this, see
       <ref.extern to="&tkcmd/focus.htm"/<kbd/focus//.

     <para class=apropos><title/returning entered text/
       To query the string entered in a widget the command <<get>> is provided.
       To display the entered string in the Browser we can execute
<chunk class=anonymous><title/entry get/

</chunk>

     <P>
       The string entered in an entry can be deleted, additional characters can
       be inserted, and so on.  More on entry widgets you can find in

  <Section id="section.widgets-2.scale">

    <P>
      A scale widget allows to select a number from a certain range by moving
      a slider.  Each time the slider is moved, an action attached to the
      slider is invoked with a single argument giving the current number value
      of the slider. 

    <P>
      In <Ptr to="figure.widgets-2.scales"> an example is shown which allows
      to display a color determined by three sliders for the intensity of the
      base colors red, green, and blue.  The object&nbsp;<<F>> stores the
      intensity for each base color in an attribute.  Whenever the method
      <<bg>> is executed it changes the intensity for one of the base colors
      and changes the background color to the combination of all three base
      colors.

      The sliders are configured with the <<label>> option to display the

      <<action>> and <<args>> are self explanatory, more information on them
      can be found in 
       <ref.extern to="&tkcmd/scale.htm"/<kbd/scale//.

    <P>
      The value for the <<args>> option must be a type specification similar to
      that used for the specification of argument types in event bindings (see
      <Ptr to="section.widgets-2.event-args">.  The only difference is that no
      event argument specification is required.  Invoking the action is also
      similar.  For instance, if the scale for the color <<red>> changes its
      value to <<10>>, the message <<bg(red 10)>> will eventually be
      served by the listener <<L>>.

      A listbox displays a list of strings and allows the user to select one

<chunk class=anonymous><title/wm title/
W={New Tk.toplevel tkInit(title:'Something different')}
</chunk>
      creates a toplevel widget with the title <Samp/Something different/.

    <para class=apropos><title/withdrawn toplevels/
      Sometimes it is important to create a toplevel widget in a <Def
      /withdrawn/ state: the toplevel widget does not appear on the screen.
      This can be used to first create all widgets to be contained in the
      toplevel widget, invoke a geometry manager for them, and only then
      make the toplevel widget appear on the screen.  A toplevel widget can
      be created in withdrawn state by
<chunk class=anonymous><title/wm withdraw/
W={New Tk.toplevel tkInit(withdraw:true)}
</chunk>

    <P>
      To make the toplevel widget appear, the window manager command
<chunk class=anonymous><title/wm deiconify/
{Tk.send wm(deiconify W)}
</chunk>
      can be used.

    <p>
      Reference information on the window manager command can be found in
      <ref.extern to="&tkcmd;/wm.htm"/<kbd/wm//.


  <Section id="section.widgets-2.file">
    <Title/Selecting Files/

    <P>
      Tk provides for predefined dialogs to select files for being opened or
      for being saved. 

    <P>
      Selecting a file to be opened can be done with the command
      <<tk_getOpenFile>>.  For example, an arbitrary file can be selected as
      shown in <Ptr to="figure.widgets-2.file">.  If the command returns the
      empty string (that is <<nil>>), the selection dialog has been canceled.
      Otherwise, the string&nbsp;<<S>> gives the filename of the file to be
      opened.
      <Figure id="figure.widgets-2.file">
        <Caption/Selecting files./
        <P>
               <picture.choice>

<chunk class=anonymous><title/file/
case {Tk.return tk_getOpenFile}
of nil then skip
elseof S then {Browse file({String.toAtom S})}
end
</chunk>
      </Figure>

    <P>
      The visual appearance of the file selector depends on the operating
      system &Oz; runs on.  For example, the file selector for Unix based
      operating systems is shown in <Ptr to="figure.widgets-2.file">.  Running
      &Oz; under Windows uses the Windows specific file selector dialog.

    <P>
      To select filenames for saving the command <<tk_getSaveFile>> can be
      used in the same way as above.  The difference is that this command
      does not require that a file with the selected filename already exists.

    <p>
      Reference information on both commands can be found in
      <ref.extern to="&tkcmd;/tk_getOpenFile.htm"/<kbd/tk_getOpenFile//.


  <Section id="section.widgets-2.help">
    <Title/Example: Help Popups/

    <P>
      In the following we want to look at a small example which provides for
      a generic interactive help popup window.  The idea is that if the mouse
      pointer stays over a widget for some time without pressing a mouse
      button, a small help text is displayed.  The help text should disappear
      if the mouse pointer leaves the screen area covered by the widget.

    <P>
      We will build a procedure <<AttachHelp>> such that help texts
      are enabled by application of
      the procedure to a widget and a help text.
      We proceed in three steps, the first is to create a function to
      create a
      toplevel widget that displays the help text, the second is a
      listener class (that is, a subclass of <<Tk.listener>>), and the
      last step is the definition of <<AttachHelp>> itself.

    <SubSection>
      <Title/Displaying Help/

      <P>
        The procedure <<MakePopup>> shown in <Ptr
        to="figure.widgets-2.help-create"> takes a widget and the help
        text as its 
        argument and returns a function to create a toplevel widget
        containing the text at a position relative to the widget on
        the screen.

      <P>
        <Figure id="figure.widgets-2.help-create">
          <Caption/Creating a help window./
<chunk><title/Definition of MakePopup/
fun {MakePopup Parent Text}
   fun {$}
      [X Y H]={Map [rootx rooty height]
               fun {$ WI}
                  {Tk.returnInt winfo(WI Parent)}
               end}
      W={New Tk.toplevel tkInit(withdraw:true bg:black)}
      M={New Tk.message
         tkInit(parent:W text:Text bg:khaki aspect:400)}
   in
      {Tk.batch [wm(overrideredirect W true)
                 wm(geometry W '+'#X+10#'+'#Y+H)
                 pack(M padx:2 pady:2)
                 wm(deiconify W)]}
      W
   end
end
</chunk>
        </Figure>

      <P>
        The returned function creates a toplevel widget in withdrawn state and
        configures the toplevel widget such that it:
        <List enum>
          <Item>
            is not equipped with a frame from the window manager.  This is
            done by using the window manager command <<overrideredirect>>:
            the window manager is advised to not <Q/redirect/ the toplevel
            widget into a frame.
          <Item>
            appears at a position relative to <<X>> and&nbsp;<<Y>>
            coordinates of the widget parent, which 
            done by the <<geometry>> window manager command.
          <Item>
            appears on the screen by deiconifying it.
        </List>

    <SubSection>
      <Title/The Listener Class/

      <P>
        The listener class <<HelpListener>> is shown in <Ptr
        to="figure.widgets-2.help-mixin">.  The method <<init>> initializes an
        instance of this class by creating
        a procedure for creation of the popup widget.

       <p>
        <Figure id="figure.widgets-2.help-mixin">
          <Caption/The listener class <<HelpListener>>./
<chunk><title/Definition of HelpListener/
class HelpListener from Tk.listener
   attr
      cancel: unit
      popup:  unit
   meth init(parent:P text:T)
      popup <- {MakePopup P T}
      Tk.listener,tkInit
   end
   meth enter
      C
   in
      cancel <- C
      thread A={Alarm 1000} in
         {WaitOr C A}
         if {IsDet A} then W={@popup} in
            {Wait C} {W tkClose}
         end
      end
   end
   meth leave
      @cancel=unit
   end
end
</chunk>
        </Figure>

      <P>
        When the mouse pointer enters the parent widget,
        the method <<enter>> gets executed. This method stores a new
        variable <<C>> in the attribute <<cancel>> which serves as
        flag whether the help popup must be closed. The newly
        created thread waits until either one second has elapsed
        (<<A>> gets bound after 1000 milliseconds) or the widget has
        been left (<<C>> gets bound). Then possibly the widget for the help
        text is created, which gets closed when the parent widget is
        left. Note that if both <<A>> and <<C>> happen to be bound at
        the same time,
        the popup will be created and then closed immediately.

      <P>
        The <<leave>> method signals that the help popup must be
        closed by binding the variable stored in <<cancel>>.

      <p>
        The definition of <<AttachHelp>> is shown in <ptr
