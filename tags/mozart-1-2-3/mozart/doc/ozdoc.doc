* Introduction

The Oz Documentation DTD provides a means to markup technical
documentation so that it is easy to convert it to alternative
publication formats such as LaTeX and HTML.

A second advantage of declarative markup is that extra value can be
automatically added.  For example, code fragments can be automatically
highlighted according to the programming language used, text can be
automatically hyphenated according to the natural language in effect,
cross-references, index entries, and hyperlinks can be automatically
introduced.

** Introduction to SGML

You can think of an SGML document as a tree of nested elements.  SGML
itself is simply a language for creating document grammars; such a
grammar is called a DTD: a Document Type Definition.  It defines both
an abstract syntax, consisting of elements, and a concrete syntax
consisting of tags.

Thus <AUTHOR>...</AUTHOR> is the concrete syntax for the scope of an
AUTHOR element.

*** Relationship to HTML

HTML is an SGML application: it uses SGML to define a DTD, i.e. an
abstract and a concrete syntax for hypertext documents.

The Oz Documentation DTD is also an SGML application, for the same
reasons.   It defines an abstract and a concrete syntax for Oz
documents.

*** Notational Tricks

The Oz Documentation DTD, supports the following abbreviations for
tags:

		<TITLE>Kinded Variables</TITLE>
may be written	<TITLE/Kinded Variables/

This abbreviation is supported for all elements.  The restriction is
that the text occurring between the 2 slashes cannot itself contain a
slash in its non-markup content.  However, elements can be nested
within, even those using this form of abbreviation:

		<TITLE/one <Q/two/ three <Q>four</Q> five/
is equivalent to
		<TITLE>one <Q>two</Q> three <Q>four</Q> five</TITLE>

*** Omitting Tags

In the Oz Documentation DTD, end tags of sectioning elements such as
CHAPTER and P can be omitted.  Ditto for ITEM and some other few
elements.  Phrase elements however require an end tag.

* General structure of a document according to the Oz DTD

<!DOCTYPE BOOK SYSTEM "ozdoc.dtd" [
<!-- entity declarations -->
]>
<BOOK>
<FRONT>
	<TITLE>...</TITLE>
	<AUTHOR>...</AUTHOR>
	<AUTHOR>...</AUTHOR>
	<META name=comic content="foo.ps">
	<ABSTRACT>...</ABSTRACT>
<BODY>
<CHAPTER><TITLE>...</TITLE>
...
<PART>   <TITLE>...</TITLE>
<CHAPTER><TITLE>...</TITLE>
...
<CHAPTER><TITLE>...</TITLE>
...
<PART>   <TITLE>...</TITLE>
<CHAPTER><TITLE>...</TITLE>
...
<CHAPTER><TITLE>...</TITLE>
...
</BOOK>

** Entity declarations

*** Macros

entities are a bit like macros.  You can add entity declarations where
it says <!-- entity declarations --> above.  For example:

	<!ENTITY quux "Guy L. Steele JR.">

would allow you to type `&quux;' in your document, and that would
automatically be replaced by `Guy L. Steele JR.'

*** Include files

Another application of entities is to denote files to be included:

	<!ENTITY section1 SYSTEM "section1-draft.sgml">

would allow you to type &section1; in your document, and that would be
replaced by the contents of file section1-draft.sgml.

*** Processing instructions

Sometimes it is useful to introduce entities that do not expand to
text, but should instead be interpreted by the processing system.
This is what a processing instruction is for.

	<!ENTITY nbsp PI "NON-BREAKING-SPACE">

an occurrence of &nbsp; in your document will result in an occurrence
of the processing instruction object identified as
NON-BREAKING-SPACE.  What to do with it is up to the processing
system.  For example, the LaTeX converter might replace it by ~ and
the HTML converter by the HTML entity &nbsp; (surprise, surprise!).

I recommend that processing instructions be given names that begin
with the prefix `PI:'

	<!ENTITY nbsp PI "PI:NBSP">

*** Marked sections

It is possible to conditionally include a part of the document:

	<![ %HTML; [...]]>

would include ... iff %HTML; is an (parameter) entity defined as
INCLUDE, i.e. if there is an entity declaration of the form:

	<!ENTITY % HTML "INCLUDE">

Normally, the `entity declarations' section of your document would
contain:

	<!ENTITY % LATEX "IGNORE">
	<!ENTITY % HTML  "IGNORE">

Thus causing marked sections marked with %LATEX; and %HTML; to be
ignored by default.  This is normally overriden on the command line,
when invoking the SGML parser, nsgmls:

	nsgmls -iHTML ...

this causes the declaration

	<!ENTITY % LATEX "INCLUDE">

to override the one in your document.  Don't abuse marked sections.
A typical use is, in the DOCTYPE header of your document, to select
which entity declarations you want to use according to the target
format for processing.

	<!DOCTYPE BOOK SYSTEM "ozdoc.dtd" [
	<!ENTITY % HTML  "IGNORE">
	<!ENTITY % LATEX "IGNORE">
	<![ %HTML;  [
	<!ENTITY target.format "HTML">
	]]>
	<![ %LATEX; [
	<!ENTITY target.format "\LaTeX{}">
	]]>
	]>

This would allow you to type &target.format; in your document and have
it expand to either HTML or \LaTeX{} according to the target format
select on nsgmls's command-line.

* BNF description of the DTD

This description is a simplified idealization of the DTD.  It provides
an intuitive overview of the element hierarchy.  Base identifiers,
e.g. TITLE, denote elements, bracketed phrases, e.g. <TEXT or PHRASE>,
denote non-terminal symbols in this BNF description.

FOO		::= BAR BAZ

means that the contents of element FOO must consist of a BAR element
followed by a BAZ element.  whereas:

<FOO>		::= BAR BAZ

means that non-terminal <FOO> can be rewritten to the sequence BAR
BAZ.

The annotation +<INDEXING> in the rule for BOOK indicates that the
elements represented by non-terminal <INDEXING> are allowed to occur
anywhere within the scope of element BOOK.

BOOK		::= FRONT BODY BACK?			+<INDEXING>

* General Principles of the DTD

** Common attributes
all elements accept the following attributes

*** ID
a document-wide unique identifier that makes it possible to refer to
the element:

	<P ID=FOO>...</P>	...	<PTR TO=FOO>

*** CLASS
a space separated list of arbitrary identifiers that further specify
the element.

	<NOTE CLASS=FOOT>...</NOTE>

would serve to indicate a footnote.

	<FIGURE FLOAT CLASS=PROGRAM>...</FIGURE>

would indicate that this floating figure contains a program.

*** LANG
a standard 2 character code for a language.  It indicates the default
language within the scope of the element and is inherited unless
explicitly overriden.  It serves e.g. to obtain appropriate language
dependent services such as hyphenation and quote delimiters.
**** EN			english
**** DE			german
**** FR			french

*** PROGLANG
this is rather similar to attribute LANG but for programming
languages.
**** OZ
**** GUMP
**** C
**** CC			C++
**** ELISP		Emacs Lisp

** Display/Inline phrase elements
Phrase elements are contained in paragraphs.  But they can be either
inline or displayed, and some can be either.  NAME is always rendered
inline.  MATH is usually inline, but can be rendered displayed through
the use of the DISPLAY attribute:

	<MATH DISPLAY>...</MATH>

Lists are usually displayed, but you could request an inline
enumeration as follows:

	<LIST INLINE ENUM>...</LIST>

The default of whether to be inline or displayed is whatever makes the
most sense for the element.  When both are possible, the non default
case can be explicitly requested using either INLINE or DISPLAY.

** External resources
some elements have variants whose data comes from an external resource
rather than from within the document itself: the name of such an
element is obtained by concatenating .EXTERN to the usual name:

e.g.	<PTR.EXTERN     TO='...'>
	<MATH.EXTERN    TO='...'>
	<PICTURE.EXTERN TO='...'>

** References
some elements can make references either to some other element within
the document or to some external resource.  This is effected through
attribute TO and may be further specified with attribute KEY.

For references within the same document TO should have as value an ID;
for external references, the value is arbitrary, but usually follows a
recognizable syntax such as a url.  KEY is arbitrary, its
interpretation will depend on the kind of thing which is being
referred to.

* Description of all elements

Since the content models are already provided by the BNF grammar
above, they will not be repeated here.

** BOOK

** FRONT
This is a container for descriptive information about the document.
Beside title, author and abstract, you may also have META elements
that make (property) statements about the document.

	<META name="ozversion" value="3.0">

** TITLE
This is used by FRONT, sectioning elements such as CHAPTER, FIGURE,
TABLE.

** AUTHOR
** AUTHOR.EXTERN
AUTHOR currently does not have internal structure.  It simply contains
the name of an author of the current document.  It is recommended to
use AUTHOR.EXTERN instead, which allows to refer to an entry in an
external author database:
*** TO			denotes the external author database
*** KEY			denotes the entry in that database

** META
Makes a (property) statement about the document.

	<META name="ozversion" value="3.0">

A possible application is to state at what elements the document
should be split into different HTML files.

	<META name="html.split" value="chapter.foo">

where chapter.foo would probably be the ID of a chapter in the
document.  Arbitrary such statements can be made.  Neither the name
nor the value attribute is restricted.

** ABSTRACT

** BODY

** CHAPTER

** SECTION
can also be called SECT1

** SUBSECTION
can also be called SECT2

** SUBSUBSECTION
can also be called SECT3

** P
the usual container for text and phrase elements

** PARA
like P, but requires a TITLE.  Thus:

	<PARA><TITLE>Invoking the zapper</TITLE>...</PARA>

might be rendered with an inline title in bold face.  In the Oz
documentation, there many paragraphs which are `about' a topic.  This
is typically rendered as a normal paragraph, but with the topic
mentioned in the margin.  Such paragraphs could be coded as follows:

	<PARA CLASS=APROPOS><TITLE>Kinded variables</TITLE>...</PARA>

Where CLASS=APROPOS is intended to indicate that the TITLE should be
interpreted as the topic of the paragraph.

** DIV
its purpose is to group together paragraphs.  For example:

	<DIV CLASS=WARNING><P>...<P>...<P>...</DIV>

could be used to markup an extended warning.  This might be rendered
with a colored background and heading saying `Warning!'.

** LIST
flexible element for marking up lists of all kinds.  A LaTeX-like
itemize is simply:
	<LIST>
	  <ITEM>...
	  <ITEM>...
	</LIST>
a LaTeX-like enumerate is obtained through attribute ENUM:
	<LIST ENUM>
	  <ITEM>...
	  <ITEM>...
	</LIST>
a LaTeX-like description can be obtained by having one or more ENTRY
elements before an ITEM
	<LIST>
	  <ENTRY>...
	  <ENTRY>...
	  <ITEM>...
	  <ENTRY>...
	  <ITEM>
	</LIST>
For describing such things as procedures, an SYNOPSIS element may
optionally follow an ENTRY and is intended to show how the procedure
is to be invoked (typically with parameters annotated with modes).
	<LIST CLASS=EXPORTS>
	  <ENTRY><<Map>>
	  <SYNOPSIS><<{Map ?+{L1} ?+{F} ??{L2}}>>
	  <ITEM>...
	</LIST>
Note the use of CLASS=EXPORTS to suggest that the list is describing
the exports of a module.

** MATH
** MATH.EXTERN
** MATH.CHOICE
the Oz Documentation DTD does not prescribe a specific marking scheme
for math.  Instead it lets the author pick an arbitrary notation.
This notation is selected by the TYPE attribute (default is LaTeX).

	<MATH>x^2+y^2=z^2</MATH>

since rendering math on different media can be tricky, the author may
also supply a choice of alternative notations:

	<MATH.CHOICE>
	  <MATH LATEX>x^2+y^2=z^2</MATH>
	  <MATH HTML>X&lt;SUP>2&lt;/SUP>+Y&lt;SUP>2&lt;/SUP>=Z&lt;SUP>2&lt;/SUP></MATH>
	  <MATH.EXTERN TO="file:fermat.gif" TYPE=gif>
	</MATH.CHOICE>
Here the same math material is coded using three different
notations. The last one refers to an external resource: the gif file
fermat.gif. Note that MATH has content, but MATH.EXTERN is empty.

** PICTURE
** PICTURE.EXTERN
** PICTURE.CHOICE
this is similar in design to the MATH elements.

** CODE
** CODE.EXTERN
** CODE.ANNOTATED
CODE contains program code in a programming language; which
programming language may be specified using the PROGLANG attribute.
All elements accept the PROGLANG attribute: it indicates the default
programming language in CODE-like elements whithin its scope. Thus, a
document starting with:

	<BOOK PROGLANG=C>

would normally assume that the programming language is C, unless this
is overriden by an element with an explicit PROGLANG attribute.  The
choice of programming language may serve to obtain appropriate
highlighting of code.

CODE contains raw program text.  Sometimes, however, it is desirable
to annotate variables within the code, for example with mode
specifications, or simply to indicate a meta-variable (as opposed to a
language level variable).  Element CODE.ANNOTATED is intended for this
purpose and allows to mix raw text and occurrences of VAR.

*** Code Abbreviations
For convenience, the Oz Documentation DTD supports the following
abbreviations:

	<<...>>		<CODE.ANNOTATED>...</CODE.ANNOTATED>
	<<<...>>>	<CODE.ANNOTATED DISPLAY>...</CODE.ANNOTATED>
	?+{X}		<VAR MODE=IN  >X</VAR>
	??{X}		<VAR MODE=OUT >X</VAR>
	?*{X}		<VAR MODE=CIN >X</VAR>
	?@{X}		<VAR MODE=CNIN>X</VAR>
	?_{X}		<VAR          >X</VAR>
	?{X}		<VAR TYPE=META>X</VAR>

Thus you can write: <<{List.map ?+{L1} ?+{F} ??{L2}}>>

** VAR
may occur in ordinary text and also in CODE.ANNOTATED elements.  VAR
serves to identify (1) programming language variables, (2) meta
variables, (3) environment variables, (4) non-terminal symbols in a
grammar.  The choice is determined by attribute TYPE.

*** TYPE
indicates the type of object represented by the VAR element
**** PROG			programming language variable
**** META			meta variable
**** ENV			environment variable
**** GRAMMAR			grammar non-terminal
*** MODE
The MODE attribute further describes the expected modes of parameters
to builtins and library procedures.
**** IN				input (determined)
**** OUT			output (usually free)
**** CIN
**** CNIN

** PTR
** REF
** PTR.EXTERN
** REF.EXTERN
serve for cross-references.  For cross-references within the same
document, use PTR or REF.  PTR is empty and REF has content.

	<REF TO=FOO>The definition of foo</REF>

might produce a hyperlink in HTML and insert reference text like
`Definition 3.2, page 17' in LaTeX.

	<PTR TO=FOO>

might insert a hyperlink with content `Definition 3.2' in HTML and
again insert `Definition 3.2, page 17' in LaTeX.  FOO is the ID of the
element containing the definition of interest.  Somewhere else in the
document there would be an element like:

	<PARA CLASS=DEFINITION ID=FOO>
	  <TITLE>Procedure <<Foo>></TITLE>
	  ...
	</PARA>

If the element pointed to is a NOTE, then in HTML, PTR might be
replaced by an hyperlinked-icon, and in LaTeX it could be replaced by
an integer refering to the note by number.  The cross-reference may be
further specified using attribute CLASS, but often it is sufficient
for the processing system to look at the element that is pointed to to
determine what kind of reference is intended.

When the object that needs to be referenced does not reside within the
current document, we must make an `external' reference.  Such
references cannot take advantage of the ID mechanism of SGML.
Instead, the TO attribute contains data which it is up to the
processing system to properly interpret, perhaps aided by a CLASS
attribute.  Often, TO will contain a url:

	Visit <REF.EXTERN TO="http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/oz/">the Oz home
	page</REF.EXTERN>

But it can contain other data for which a conventional interpretation
has been assigned in the processing system.  Thus, we might refer to
the Open Programming Manual as follows:

	For details about IO programming, see <PTR.EXTERN
	TO="ozdoc:open">.

** FILE
borrowed from Texinfo.  marks up a file name:

	<FILE>/usr/local/oz/README</FILE>

** KBD
borrowed from Texinfo.  marks up keyboard input:

	<KBD>M-a</KBD>

** KEY
borrowed from Texinfo.  marks up the conventional name for a key on a
keyboard:

	<KEY>RET</KEY>

However, this can also be marked up using NAME:

	<NAME TYPE=KEY>RET</NAME>

** SAMP
borrowed from Texinfo.  marks up a literal example of a sequence of
characters:

	<SAMP>foo</SAMP>

** NAME
marks text that names an object; which kind of object should be
indicated using the TYPE attribute.
*** TYPE
	<NAME TYPE=FICTIONAL.CREATURE>Gump</>
	<NAME TYPE=TOOL>Gump</>
	<NAME TYPE=CHAR>NUL</>
	<NAME TYPE=PERSON>Denys Duchier</>
	<NAME TYPE=KEY>RET</>
	<NAME TYPE=OS>Linux</>

** Q
marks quoted phrases:

	Man, I hated that book!  You hang in there through all that
	dreary prose and for his big finale, his major piece of bloody
	wisdom, all he's got to tell you is <Q LANG=FR>La vie, ça n'est
	jamais si bon ni si mauvais qu'on croit</Q>.  Bummer, man!
	What a let down!

or	Here goes another one of Microsoft's <Q
	CLASS=SOCALLED>upgrades</Q>; down the drain, where it belongs!

** SPAN
this element has no particular semantics but serves mainly to mark an
otherwise undistinguished piece of text so that it can be assigned an
ID (e.g. for cross reference purposes) or a CLASS for whatever purpose
was not anticipated by the DTD.

	<SPAN ID=FOO>...</>	...	<PTR TO=FOO>	...

** DEF
marks the defining occurrence of a term or phrase.  It would probably
be used to contribute an entry in a glossary section.  It should
probably be further specified using the CLASS attribute to indicate
what kind of term is being defined.

** FIGURE
a figure contains displayed material.  It may have an optional TITLE,
and an optional CAPTION containing a longer description.  Here is an
example adapted from the TEI DTD documentation:

	<FIGURE>
	  <TITLE>Mr Fezziwig's Ball</TITLE>
	  <CAPTION>A Cruikshank engraving showing Mr Fezziwig leading
		   a group of revellers</CAPTION>
	  <PICTURE.EXTERN TO="fezziwig.jpg">
	</FIGURE>

*** FLOAT
A FIGURE may also float outside of the main flow of the document.
This can be indicated by attribute FLOAT:

	<FIGURE FLOAT>...</FIGURE>

The CLASS attribute should be used to indicate what kind of a figure
it is:

	<FIGURE FLOAT CLASS=PICTURE>...</FIGURE>

Such an indication makes it possible to automatically generate a
caption label that indicates this type and to cross-reference the
figure in the appropriate list (e.g. here: a list of pictures).

** NOTE
another kind of normally floating material.  The difference between a
floating figure and a note is that the latter usually leaves a trace
in the main flow of the document.  For example, footnotes typically
leave a superscripted integer behind.  The attribute CLASS should be
used to indicate what kind of NOTE is intended,

*** FOOT
since footnotes are a major application of NOTEs, the attribute FOOT
can be used instead of CLASS=FOOT:

	<NOTE FOOT>...</NOTE>   =   <NOTE CLASS=FOOT>..</NOTE>

** INDEX
** INDEX.BEGIN
** INDEX.END
INDEX is allowed everywhere in the scope of the BOOK element.

	<INDEX>foo</INDEX>

When several levels of indexing are required, they can be entered
separated by <AND>:

	<INDEX>foo<AND>bar<AND>baz</INDEX>

The CLASS attribute can be used to support multiple kinds of indexes:

	<INDEX CLASS=PERSON>Maupassant</INDEX>
	<INDEX CLASS=PROCEDURE>FoldL</INDEX>

For a `see' reference:

	<INDEX>un<AND>deux<SEE>one<AND>two<AND>french</INDEX>

*** SEE
allows one index to refer to another by ID, and is another way to mark
up a `see' reference:

	<INDEX ID=one.two.fr>one<AND>two<AND>french</INDEX>
	...
	<INDEX SEE=one.two.fr>un<AND>deux</INDEX>

*** SORT.AS
For each level of indexing, it may be necessary to distinguish between
the text used as the content of the entry and the text used to perform
sorting on the labels.  The SORT.AS attribute is intended to supply
text to use for sorting instead of the contents.

*** SCOPE
To index a range of pages, you may supply one or more element IDs as
the value of the SCOPE attribute.

	<INDEX SCOPE=section.bar>foo<AND>bar</INDEX>

would associate to this index entry the range of pages covered by the
element whose ID is section.bar.

	<INDEX SCOPE="par.bar1 par.bar2">foo<AND>bar</INDEX>

would associate with the entry the range of pages covered by the two
elements with ID par.bar1 and par.bar2 (presumably consecutive).

** GRAMMAR.RULE
** GRAMMAR.ALT
** GRAMMAR.NOTE
formal syntactic definitions often make use of BNF-like notation.
A GRAMMAR.RULE marks up a grammatical production.  The body of the
rule consists of a sequence of GRAMMAR.ALT elements.  Each GRAMMAR.ALT
element may end with a GRAMMAR.NOTE element that provides an inline
comment for the element.

*** TYPE
GRAMMAR.ALT can be further specified using attribute TYPE
**** DEF
indicates that this element begins a new rule body.  Usually this is
rendered with an initial symbol like ::=
**** ADD
indicates that this element begins a new rule body to be added as an
additional alternative to the alternatives previously defined for the
head non-terminal.  Usually this is rendered with an initial symbol
like +=
**** OR
indicates the start of the next alternative rewriting.  Usually this
is rendered with initial symbol |
**** SPACE
indicates the continuation of the previous GRAMMAR.ALT element.
Usually this is rendered by breaking to a newline but omitting any
initial symbol

** TABLE
** TR
** TD
** TH
a TABLE consist of rows marked with TR.  A row consists of a sequence
of data TD and header TH cells, each of which may span several columns
as specified by attribute COLSPAN.

*** COLSPAN
for TH and TD, indicates the number of column spanned by the element.
When omitted, the cell spans exactly one column.

** BACK
container for back-matter material, such as BIB.EXTERN for
bibliographic entries.

** BIB.EXTERN
refers to a specific entry denoted by attribute KEY in an external
bibliographic database denoted by TO.

	<BIB.EXTERN ID=ZIPPY TO="weirdo.bib" KEY="elzippo91">

*** ID
the ID makes it possible to `cite' the entry:

	<PTR TO=ZIPPY>

*** TO
denotes an external bibliographic database from which the actual
contents of the bibliographic entry will have to be extracted.

*** KEY
denotes the desired entry in the external bibliographic database.

* Extending the DTD

For a particular document, it may be desirable to slightly modify or
extend the DTD.  You can do this by defining input.local as a SYSTEM
entity referring to a file containg the required definitions.  This
file is read after the generic attribute entities have been declared,
but before the remaining entities having to do with content models.

Thus the file can contain declarations for additional elements that
can take advantage of the generic attribute entities, and it can
override the content model parameter entities if necessary (this is
because the 1st declaration of an entity wins, subsequent declarations
for the same entity are ignored).

Normally, at the most, you should consider adding some phrasal
elements.  This can be done simply by defining parameter entity
p.mix.local:

	<!ENTITY % p.mix.local "| foo | bar">

Note the leading vertical bar: it is required because p.mix.local is
concatenated to the end of a disjunction of elements.

The typical way to extend the DTD is to place your declarations in a
file, say myaddons.sgml, which may also contain a definition of
p.mix.local as shown above.  Then your document should use a DOCTYPE
header of the form:

<DOCTYPE BOOK SYSTEM "ozdoc.dtd" [
<!ENTITY % input.local SYSTEM "myaddons.sgml">
]>
