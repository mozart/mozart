<Title/Summary/

<P>
This chapter briefly outlines the features of the Oz Explorer.
</P>

<Para Class=Apropos><Title/Invoking/ The Explorer is invoked by
applying it to a <Em/script/. It can be applied to both a script and
an <Em/order/, which switches the Explorer to branch and bound mode
such that it supports best solution search.
</Para>

<Para Class=Apropos><Title/Exploring/ The search tree of the current
script can be explored in a user-guided manner.  Starting from any
node in the search tree further parts can be explored. Explored parts
of the search tree are drawn as they are explored.
</Para>

<P>
Search trees can be explored in a depth-first fashion up to the next
solution. Entire subtrees as well as single nodes can be
explored. Exploration and/or drawing can be stopped and resumed at any
time.
</P>

<Para Class=Apropos><Title/Information Access/ Nodes in the tree
representing choices and solutions carry as information their
corresponding computation spaces. The Explorer gives first-class
access to them by predefined or user-defined procedures.
</Para>

<P>
Statistical information is available in a status bar during
exploration. Detailed statistical information with respect to a
subtree can be accessed by predefined or user-defined procedures.
</P>
 
<Para Class=Apropos><Title/Display Economics/ The display of large
search trees can be kept economic by scaling the tree and by hiding
subtrees.  Support for automatically hiding complete subtrees not
containing solutions is provided. Hidden subtrees can be unhidden on
demand.
</Para>

<Para Class=Apropos><Title/Recomputation/ The Explorer can run scripts
with a large number of constraints and propagators and with large
search trees efficiently with respect to both space and
time. User-configurable recomputation can be employed to trade space
for time for scripts which would require to much memory otherwise.
</Para>

<Para Class=Apropos><Title/Postscript Output/ The search tree of a
script can be dumped in postscript format.
</Para>

<Para Class=Apropos><Title/Finding Nodes/ Nodes in the search tree can
be selected directly or by convenient short cuts.
</Para>
