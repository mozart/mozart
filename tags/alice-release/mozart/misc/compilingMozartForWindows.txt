		Compiling the Mozart For Windows
		--------------------------------
The creation of Mozart release for Windows can be divided into two steps. 

1) The Compilation
------------------
The Mozart Programming System for Windows platform is created by 
cross-compilation. For cross-compilation we use the mingw32 compiler and
the gcc-2.95 compiler under Linux RedHat6.2 or RedHat7.0.


The Cross-compiler and libraries needed for compilation are available from:

http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~dragan/mozart/

The Files are:
- cross-tools.tar.gz
- build.tar.gz

There are also two sh-scripts "cross-mozart-win1.sh" and "cross-mozart-win2.sh"
available.
The "cross-mozart-win1.sh" is for compiling of the linux-part and 
the "cross-mozart-win2.sh" is for the windows part.
The result is the file "mozart-win32.zip" containing the windows version of 
Mozart.
These scripts are adjusted for cross-compiler and libraries installed under
the /home/dragan directory (ps.uni-sb.de). If you install cross-compiler 
somewhere else, you have to make change in the scripts.
The compiled Mozart will be creayed under /tmp/mozart-win/win-part directory.
To test the created version you unzip it somewhere and double-click on oz.exe.


2) Creation of self-installing setup.exe
----------------------------------------
To be able to create self extracting setup.exe you must install 
"InstallShield for Windows Installer" and "HTML Work Shop".

a) Unzip mozart-win32.zip under C:\ 

b) First you have to create Mozart.chm. If you have installed "HTML Work Shop" 
under "C:\Program Files\", you can run the following from a DOS prompt.

DOS_PROMPT>cd /D C:\mozart-win32\doc\doc  "C:\Program Files\HTML Help Workshop\hhc" Mozart

or if you have CYGWIN
BASH_PROMPT>cd //C/mozart-win32/doc; //C/Program Files/HTML\ Help\ Workshop\hhc Mozart

c) Now you are ready to create setup.exe.

DOS_PROMPT>set PATH=C:\Program Files\InstallShield\InstallShield for Windows Installer\System;%PATH%

DOS_PROMPT>IsCmdBld -p C:\YOUR_DIR_FOR_MOZART_ISM_FILE\Mozart.ism -d Mozart -r <RELEASE_NAME> -c COMP -a <BUILD_LABEL>

Where variables are:
YOUR_DIR_FOR_MOZART_ISM_FILE = "the place where you keep your Mozart.ism"

RELEASE_NAME = You can give any name you like. If name contains spaces, it must be enclosed with quotation marks.

BUILD_LABEL = You can give any name you like.

d)
This creates the setup program  C:\tmp\Mozart\<RELEASE_NAME>\<BUILD_LABEL>\DISK1\setup.exe.
