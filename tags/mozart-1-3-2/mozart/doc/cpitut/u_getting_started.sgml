<Title/Building a Propagator/
<p>
This section explains by means of an example the constraint propagator
interface of Oz. We implement the propagator for the constraint
<Math/x+y=z/. For the sake of clarity we use a rather straightforward
algorithm here. The operational semantics will provide as much
pruning/propagation as possible. This is in contrast to the constraint
<Math/x+y=z/ supplied by the finite domain library (see <Ptr.Extern
to="ozdoc:system" key="section.fd.misc">), which reasons only over
bounds of domains.

<Title/A Propagator's Class Definition/

<para class=apropos><title/&cpi class <<OZ_Propagator>>/ The emulator
requires a uniform way to refer to all instances of propagators. This
is realised by providing the class <<OZ_Propagator>>, which is the
class all propagators have to be inherited from. Therefore, the
emulator can refer to any propagator by a pointer of type
<<(OZ_Propagator *)>> The class <<OZ_Propagator>> is in terms of &cpp;
a so-called <Em/abstract base class/, &ie no object of such a class
can be created (since for at least one member function intentionally
no implementation is provided, indicated by an appended
<<=0>>. Instead, it defines the minimal functionality required of all
classes inherited from it. The following code depicts a fragment of
the definition of the class <<OZ_Propagator>> defined by the &cpi (in
the file <<mozart_cpi.hh>>). It shows all member functions which have
to be defined in a derived class.

<Code.Extern display proglang=cc to="programs/ozpropdef.hh" class=linenumbers>

<p>
There are basically three groups of member functions dealing with
reflection, memory management, and constraint propagation.  Member
functions concerned with reflection allow to obtain information about
a certain instance of a propagator. For example, this is used to
generate a message in case of a top-level failure.

<para class=apropos><title/<<getProfile()>>/ For each propagator
class, one instance of class <<OZ_PropagatorProfile>> is
allocated. This class is intended to give the Oz Profiler access to
some information about this class, for instance a count of the number
of invocations of propagators belonging to this class. This function
must return a pointer to this instance, but otherwise the programmer
needs not to be concerned about it. Note that for the profile function
to be shared for all instances, it has to be declared <<static>>.
<p>

<para class=apropos><title/<<getParameters()>>/
The arguments of a propagator
are returned by <<getParameters()>> as a list
represented as an Oz heap data structure. This is denoted by the return
type <<OZ_Term>>.


<para class=apropos><title/<<sizeOf()>>/
Memory management of Oz requires to know the size of a propagator. The
member function <<sizeOf()>> implements this
functionality. Its return type is defined in the standard header
<<&lt;stddef.h&gt>>. 

<para class=apropos><title/<<gCollect()>> and <<sClone()>>/ Further, on
garbage collection and space cloning references into heap which are
held in the state of the propagator (or somehow reachable by a
propagator) have to be updated, since items stored on the heap are
occasionally moved to a new location. The member functions
<<gcollect()>> and <<sClone>> are provided for that purpose. The
definition of these functions is identical for most propagators. For
an example where the difference of both functions matters see <ptr
to="u_advanced.redundant">.

<para class=apropos><title/<<propagate()>>/
The most important member function is <<propagate()>>.
It is responsible for the actual
constraint propagation and is called by the emulator when the
propagator's execution state is switched to <<running>>.  The returned
value of type <<OZ_Return>> indicates the runtime system the outcome
of the propagation performed by <<propagate()>>.
<p>
The implementation of the addition propagator starts with the definition
of the class <<AddProp>>. The definition of the member function
<<propagate()>> is explained in <ptr to="u_getting_started.propagation">.

<Code.Extern display proglang=cc to="programs/ex_a.1.cc" class=linenumbers>
<Code.Extern display proglang=cc to="programs/ex_a.2.cc" class=linenumbers>


The propagator stores in its state, &ie in its data members, references
to the variables it is imposed on (namely <<_x>>, <<_y>> and <<_z>> of
type <<OZ_Term>>. The constructor of the 
class <<AddProp>>, which is invoked by the header function, initialises the
data members with the arguments of the corresponding Oz application.

The member function <<sizeOf()>> returns the number of bytes occupied
by the addition propagator using &ccpp;'s <<sizeof>> operator.  The
&cpi provides for the functions <<OZ_gCollectTerm()>> and
<<OZ_sCloneTerm()>>, which are used for the implemention of the member
functions <<gcollect()>> and <<sClone()>>, which apply
<<gCollectTerm()>> resp. <<sCloneTerm()>> to all data members of type
<<OZ_Term>>. The construction of lists is supported by the interface
abstractions <<OZ_cons()>> and <<OZ_nil()>> (see <Ptr.Extern
to="ozdoc:foreign" key="section.term_access">). The function
<<getParameters()>> straightforwardly composes a list containing the
references to the arguments hold in the propagator's state.

The reason for the friend declaration will become clear in <Ptr
to="u_getting_started.creating">.
<p>

<SubSubSection id="u_getting_started.propagation">
<Title/The Propagation Part of a Propagator/
<p>
The member function <<propagate()>> implements the algorithm which
defines the operational semantics of the propagator, &ie the amount of
constraint propagation achieved at each invocation.
<p>
The algorithm used here rebuilds the domains of the variables always
from scratch. Therefore, auxiliary domains for each variable are
introduced which are initially empty. For all values of the domains of
<Math/x/ and <Math/y/ it is checked if there is a consistent value in
the domain 
of <Math/z/. If so, the values are added to the corresponding auxiliary
domains. Finally, the domains of the variables are constrained,
&ie intersected, with the corresponding auxiliary
domains. Consequently, the core of the program code consists of two
nested loops iterating over all values of the domains of <Math/x/ and 
<Math/y/.

<Code.Extern display proglang=cc to="programs/ex_a.3a.cc" class=linenumbers>
<Code.Extern display proglang=cc to="programs/ex_a.3.cc" class=linenumbers>

<para class=apropos><title/&cpi class <<OZ_FDIntVar>>/
A propagator needs direct
access to the variables it is imposed on. The interface class
<<OZ_FDIntVar>> provides member functions to access variables in the 
constraint store. The constructor dereferences a variable in the store
and stores the dereferenced information in the state of the newly
created object. The operators <<*>> and <<-&gt>> are overloaded to
provide direct access to the finite domain of a variable in the 
store or to invoke member functions of the class <<OZ_FiniteDomain>>
(see below). 
<p>

<para class=apropos><title/&cpi class <<OZ_FiniteDomain>>/
The finite domain of a variable is represented by an instance of the
class <<OZ_FiniteDomain>>, modifying their value is immediately
visible in
the constraint store. Calling the constructor with the value
<<fd_empty>> creates an empty finite domain, as used for the
auxiliary variables here. The operator <<+=>> adds a value to a
domain. The operator <<&=>> intersects two domains, modifies the
domain on the left hand side and returns the size of the intersected
domain. The member function <<getMinElem()>> returns the smallest value
of the domain and <<getNextLargerElem(i)>> returns the smallest value
of the domain larger than <<i>> (both return <<-1>> when they reach
their respective end of the domain). Testing whether a value is contained
in a domain or not can be done by the member function <<isIn()>>.


<para class=apropos><title/The implementation/
The implementation of the constraint
<Math/x+y=z/ proceeds as follows. First the variables in the store are
retrieved and stored in the local &ccpp; variables <<x>>, <<y>> and
<<z>>. The corresponding auxiliary domains are held in the
variables <<x_aux>>,  <<y_aux>> and <<z_aux>>, 
which are
initialised to empty domains. Two nested for-loops enumerate all
possible pairs <Math/(v_x,v_y)/ of values of the domains of <Math/x/
and <Math/y/. Each 
loop starts from the smallest value of the domain and proceeds until
<Math/-1/ 
is returned, indicating that there is no larger value. If there is a
value <Math/v_z/ in the domain of <Math/z/ satisfying the relation
<Math/v_x + v_y = v_z/,
these values are added to the appropriate auxiliary
domains. After completing the nested loops, the domains of the variables
are constrained by intersecting them with the auxiliary domains.
 
<para class=apropos><title/<<FailOnEmpty()>>/
The
macro <<FailOnEmpty()>> branches to the label
<<failure>> if its argument results in the value <Math/0/. Thereby,
constraining the domain of a variable to an empty domain causes the
execution to branch to label <<failure>> and eventually to return
<<OZ_FAILED>> to the emulator. The return value of the member function
<<leave()>> of class <<OZ_FDIntVar>>  is used to decide whether the
propagator returns <<OZ_SLEEP>> or <<OZ_ENTAILED>>. 
The return value
<<OZ_ENTAILED>> indicates entailment and is returned if all variable's
domains are singletons. Otherwise, <<OZ_SLEEP>> is returned and the
propagator is resumed when at least one of its variables is
constrained again.

<p>
Before leaving <<propagate()>>, the member function <<leave()>> has to
be called. If the variable's domain has been constrained by the
propagator, it causes the scheduler to switch all propagators waiting
for further constraints on that variable to become <<runnable>>. The
return value of <<leave>> is <Math/0/ if the domain became a singleton,
otherwise <Math/1/. This information is used to decide whether a propagator
is entailed or not. In case the propagator encounters an empty domain or
any other inconsistency, the member function <<fail()>> has to be
called to do some cleanups before <<propagate()>> is left.

<SubSubSection id="u_getting_started.creating">
<Title/Creating a Propagator/

<para class=apropos><title/The header function/ Before a propagator
can be created and introduced to the emulator, its variables must be
sufficiently constrained, e.g. the variables must be constrained to
finite domains. In case, only a subset of variables is sufficiently
constrained, the computation will suspend and resume again when more
constraints become available. This is checked by the header function,
which is called by the runtime system, when an appropriately connected
Oz abstraction is applied.  For our example, this function is
called <<fd_add>>.

<para class=apropos><title/Determining when to resume a propagator/
Further, when a propagator is imposed on a variable, it has to be
determined which changes to the domain resume the propagator
again. The alternatives are to resume a propagator if the variable's
domain becomes a singleton, the bounds are narrowed or some value is
removed from the domain.

<p> The macros <<OZ_C_proc_begin>> and <<OZ_C_proc_end>> are provided
to allow the implementation of &ccpp; functions which are compliant
with the calling conventions of Oz's emulator.

<p> The first argument of the macro <<OZ_C_proc_begin>> defines the
name of the function and the second argument the number of arguments
of type <<OZ_Term>>. The macro <<OZ_args>> provides access to the
actual argument. The name of the function has to obey certain rules to
be compatible with the module <<Foreign>> which enables linking object
files to a running Oz runtime system. The definition of the macro
<<OZ_EXPECTED_TYPE>> is explained in <Ptr.Extern to="ozdoc:cpiref"
key="expect.macros">.

<Code.Extern display proglang=cc to="programs/ex_a.4.cc" class=linenumbers>

<para class=apropos><title/Using <<OZ_EXPECT>>/ The macro
<<OZ_EXPECT>> ensures that incompatible constraints on the
propagator's parameters lead to failure and insufficient constraints
cause the execution to be suspended until more constraints become
known. An object of class <<OZ_Expect>> collects in its state all
variables the propagator is to be imposed on. Such an object is at the
first argument position of <<OZ_EXPECT>>. The second argument of
<<OZ_EXPECT>> determines which argument of <<fd_add>> shall be
checked. The member function <<expectIntVar()>> of class <<OZ_Expect>>
expects a variable to be already constrained to a finite domain. If a
variable is sufficiently constrained, it is stored in the state of the
object <<pe>>. The second argument of <<expectIntVar>> is used to
determine what kind of domain pruning causes a propagator to be
resumed. Its default value is <<fd_prop_any>>, &ie a propagator is
resumed on any pruning of the domain.  For further details see <ptr
to="u_nesting">.

<para class=apropos><title/Creation of a propagator/ Finally, the
actual propagator is created by calling its constructor via the
application of the <<new>> operator. The reference to the newly
created propagator is passed as argument to <<impose()>>, a member
function of <<OZ_Expect>>, which executes the <<propagate()>> method
and introduces the propagator to the emulator.

<para class=apropos><Title/Connecting Propagators and Oz Code/
Propagators are connected with &moz3; as native functors according to
<Ptr.Extern to="ozdoc:apptut"
key="section.counter.global.compilation.deployment">. To enable that
one has to define a function <<oz_init_module>>.

<Code.Extern display proglang=cc to="programs/ex_a.interface.cc">

The line <<AddProp::profile = "addition/3";>> assigns explicitly the
name <<"addition/3">> to the propagator. The default name is <<"&lt;anonymous propagator&gt;">>.
<P>
Before a native functor can be loaded it must be compiled according to
<Ptr.Extern to="ozdoc:apptut"
key="section.counter.global.compilation">. Supposing the &ccpp; code
is stored in the file <<ex_a.cc>>, then the following lines create the
object file.

<Code display proglang=sh>
oztool c++ -c ex_a.cc -o ex_a.o
oztool ld  -o ex_a.so-linux-i486 ex_a.o  
</Code>

<p>
The Oz code below loads the object file <<ex_a.so-linux-i486>> and
makes the Oz abstraction <<FD_PROP.add>> available. The procedure
<<FD_PROP.add>> takes 3 arguments and imposes the addition propagator
implemented in the sections before.

<Code.Extern display to="programs/ex_a.1.oz" class=linenumbers>

After feeding in the above Oz code the addition propagator is available
and can be used. To do so feed the following code in line by line. The
results are shown in the Oz browser (shown in comments appended to
lines).

<Code.Extern display to="programs/ex_a.2.oz" class=linenumbers>

<para class=apropos><Title/Troubleshooting/

<p> Debugging a propagator is usually done by <Code proglang=sh/gdb/
<Ptr to="gdb"> in conjunction with <Code proglang=sh/emacs/ <Ptr
to="stallman91">. The Oz Programming Interface provides adequate
means to support debugging based on these two tools. We refer the
reader to <Ptr.Extern to="ozdoc:opi" key="section.intro.gdb"> for
details.
