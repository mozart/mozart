Lindenmayer systems are used to model the development of plants (see
<Ptr to="Lindenmayer:90">). They are basically rewriting systems,
which generate a term describing the topology of a plant. The starting
point is an initial term, which is successively expanded by replacing
parts of it with the initial term itself. The final expansion of the
plant is determined by the number of rewriting steps.

The term describing a plant's topology (in short topology term) is a
sequence of drawing instructions represented by an ordinary list.  A
graphical representation of such a plant can be obtained by
appropriately interpreting the list holding drawing instructions. The
semantics of the drawing instructions is given below, supposing a
current state:

<List>
<Entry> <<[...]>>
<Item> a sequence of drawing instructions, whereby all modifications
of the state are local to the sequence.

<Entry> <<f>> <Item> draw a line from the current position using the
current orientation and the step-width <Math/l/.

<Entry> <<l>> <Item> turn the current orientation by <Math/\delta/
degrees to the left.

<Entry> <<r>> <Item> turn the current orientation by <Math/\delta/
degrees to the right.

</List>

<P> The state represents the current position and the current
orientation. The arc <Math/\delta/ (used by rotations) and the
stepwidth <Math/l/ (used for moving from one position to another) are
supposed to be constant while drawing.


<Para><Title/Description of <File/Flowers.oz// The variables
<<FlowerA>> and <<FlowerB>> hold descriptions of plants using a proper
record. Such a description consists of an initial state (fields at
features <<xPos>>, <<yPos>> and <<angle>>), the term describing the
topology (field at feature <<grammar>> and the field at feature
<<start>> as initial value for the rewriting process), the parameters
<Math/l/ (field at feature <<stepWidth>>) and <Math/\delta/ (field at
feature <Math/delta/), and the recursion depth (field at feature
<<recDepth>>), which determines the number rewriting cycles. The
central procedure of the program is <<DrawFlower>>. It implements a
kind of rewriting system which interlaces expansion and drawing of the
topology term. You may try to find new flower topologies by modifying
the descriptions held by the mentioned variables <<FlowerA>> and
<<FlowerB>>.

<P> After starting the program a window pops up. The growing of the
flowers can then be controlled by pressing the appropriate buttons
which meaning ought to be self-explanatory.

<P> The program <File/Flowers3d.oz/ renders a three-dimensional
flower. The principle remains unchanged only the computation for the
drawing is slightly more complicated.
