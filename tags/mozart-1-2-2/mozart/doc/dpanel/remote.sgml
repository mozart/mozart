<chapter id="chapter.remote"><title/Monitoring remote Mozart engines/

<p>In <ptr to=chapter.chapter1> we have seen how the Distribution
Panel can be used to monitor communication to and from its own
site. The Distribution Panel can also be used to monitor communication
between remote Mozart engines. The communication frame can be opened
locally for especially connected remote engines. This is a feature
useful in distributed debugging, but must be used with care.
Connecting creates extra communication that must be taken into account
when viewing the statistics and may alter the behaviour of the
application.

<p>To connect Distribution Panels do the following:
<list>
  <entry><<{DistributionPanel.server ?P}>> 
    <item>This call prepares the DistributionPanel to act as a server
    able to monitor connected engines. A port is returned and is to be
    used for such connections.

  <entry><<{DistributionPanel.client P}>>
    <item>If <<P>> is a port created by <<{DistributionPanel.server?P}>> 
    this will connect the calling ozengine to the ozengine who created P.

</list>

<p>In the Distribution Panel of the server, an asterix (<<*>>) will appear
next to the site of connected clients. By right clicking such a site,
the communication frame of that client will be opened in a seperate
window at the server and the client will be told to start sending
information on its communication. When the new window is closed the
reports will be stopped.
