  <Title/Backwards Compatibility/
  <P>
    The modules described in this chapter provide functionality to increase
    interoperability with or upgrade from previous releases of Mozart.
  <Section>
    <Title/The <<TextPickle>> module/
    <P>
      The <<TextPickle>> module allows one to read text pickles written
      by Mozart 1.0.1.  It may be imported as follows:
      <<<import TextPickle at 'x-oz://contrib/compat/TextPickle.ozf'>>>
      <List>
	<Entry><<TextPickle.load>>
	<Synopsis><<{TextPickle.load ?+{V} ?_{X} ??{YTs}}>>
	<Item>takes the name of a file ?_{V} containing a text pickle
	  and parses it.  Returns the value represented by the pickle
	  in&nbsp;?_{X}.  ?_{X}&nbsp;may have holes (unbound variables) in
	  place of the data structures that could not be converted (at the
	  moment, these include procedures and extensions except byte strings).
	  ?_{YTs} maps these holes to low-level descriptions of the
	  corresponding data structures as described by the pickle; for
	  procedures, this includes the instructions making up the body.
