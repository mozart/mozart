  <Title/Files/
  <P>
    This section explains by means of examples how to read data from and
    write data to a file.

  <Section id="section.files.basic">
    <Title/Basic Patterns of Use/
    <P>
      The basic idea of how to use files in Mozart is as follows.  We provide
      a class <<Open.file>>.  To an object created from this class
      we refer to as <Def/file object/<Index/file<And>object/.  Conceptually, its 
      state consists of a string together with the current position in this
      string called <Def/seek pointer/.
    <P>
      In the following, we will refer to this particular string as <Def/file/.
      It is visible to other operating system processes via the operating
      system's filesystem.
    <P>
      The atoms used for labels and fields of methods of the class
      <<Open.file>> are chosen to coincide with the common operating system
      terminology (&ie;, POSIX terminology).
    <SubSection>
      <Title/Reading a File/
      <P>
	Suppose we want to read data from a file named <File/a.txt/.  The
	contents of this file is as follows<Note foot/The <Ref.extern
	to="OpenProgramming.oz"/demo file/ for this 
	document contains the &Oz; code to create this file./:
	<Table>
	  <TR>
	    <TH/<P.silent>/
	    <TH/0/<TH/1/<TH/2/<TH/3/<TH/4/<TH/5/<TH/6/<TH/7/<TH/8/<TH/9/
	  <TR>
	    <TH/0/
	    <TD/H/<TD/e/<TD/l/<TD/l/<TD/o/<TD/H/<TD/e/<TD/l/<TD/l/<TD/o/
	  <TR>
	    <TH/10/
	    <TD/O/<TD/z/<TD/_/<TD/I/<TD/s/<TD/_/<TD/b/<TD/e/<TD/a/<TD/u/
	  <TR>
	    <TH/20/
	    <TD/t/<TD/i/<TD/f/<TD/u/<TD/l/
	    <TD/<P.silent>/<TD/<P.silent>/<TD/<P.silent>/
	    <TD/<P.silent>/<TD/<P.silent>/
	</Table>
      <P>
	The first step is to create a file object and associate it to the
	file <File/a.txt/.  This is done by feeding
<chunk class=anonymous><title/file init/
F={New Open.file init(name:'a.txt' flags:[read])}
</chunk>
	<Index class=module/Open<And>file<And>init/
	The list <<[read]>> used as value of the field <<flags>> means
	that we want to have read access to the file.
      <P>
	After the file has been opened and associated to the file
	object&nbsp;<<F>>, we can read from it.  To read the next five
	characters from the file we feed
<chunk class=anonymous><title/file read1/
{F read(list:{Browse} size:5)}
</chunk>
	<Index class=module/Open<And>file<And>read/
	The character string <<Hello>> appears in the browser window (the
	value&nbsp;<<5>> at the field <<size>> signals that we want to read
	five characters from the file).
      <P>
	Note that if we had not switched the browser to the mode for
	displaying virtual strings (see <Ptr to="chapter.data">), we would
	have seen the output <<[72 101 108 108 111]>> in the browser window.
      <P>
	A common pattern of use is to read the entire file into an &Oz;
	string.  This is especially supported.  Feed:
<chunk class=anonymous><title/file read2/
{F read(list:{Browse} size:all)}
</chunk>
	<Index class=module/Open<And>file<And>read/
	The rest of the file <<HelloOz is beautiful>> appears in the
	browser window.
      <P>
	Up to now we have read the data in strict left to right fashion.
	Suppose we want to start reading at the eighth character of the file.
	Navigating to this character and reading the following five characters
	is done by:
<chunk class=anonymous><title/file seek/
{F seek(whence:set offset:7)}
{F read(list:{Browse} size:5)}
</chunk>
	<Index class=module/Open<And>file<And>read/
	<Index class=module/Open<And>file<And>seek/
	You will see <<lloOz>> in the browser window.  Internally, as already
	mentioned, each file object has a <Def/seek pointer/.  Each operation
	refers to its position: for instance, instead of <Q/reading five
	characters/ one should think of <Q/reading the next five characters
	after the seek pointer/.  Note that in order to read the first
	character of a file, the seek pointer must be set to the offset zero.
      <P>
	Furthermore, you can get the current position of the seek pointer by:
<chunk class=anonymous><title/file tell/
{F tell(offset:{Browse})}
</chunk>
	<Index class=module/Open<And>file<And>tell/
	The number <<12>> appears in the browser window.
    <SubSection>
      <Title/Closing a File/
      <P>
	After use, the file object&nbsp;<<F>> must be closed.  By applying
	<<F>> to the message <<close>>:
<chunk class=anonymous><title/file close/
{F close}
</chunk>
	<Index class=module/Open<And>file<And>close/
	the file as well as the file object are closed.  Note that invoking a
	method other than <<close>> of the class <<Open.file>> after the object
	has been closed raises an exception.  Exceptions are discussed later.
    <SubSection>
      <Title/Writing a File/
      <P>
	Suppose we want to create an object for a file which does not yet exist
	and that should be named <File/ours.txt/.  Furthermore, this file
	should have read and write access rights for yourself and for each
	member of your group.  We feed
<chunk class=anonymous><title/file initwrite/
F={New Open.file 
       init(name:  'ours.txt'
            flags: [write create]
            mode:  mode(owner: [read write] 
                        group: [read write]))}
</chunk>
	<Index class=module/Open<And>file<And>init/
	Data to be written to the file must be virtual strings.  For
	example, the character sequence <<"Go ahead">> can be written to
	the file&nbsp;<<F>> by
<chunk class=anonymous><title/file write1/
{F write(vs:'Go ahead!')}
</chunk>
	<Index class=module/Open<And>file<And>write/
	The same character sequence we also can write by
<chunk class=anonymous><title/file write2/
{F write(vs:"Go ahead!")}
</chunk>
	<Index class=module/Open<And>file<And>write/
      <P>
	Also more complex virtual strings are handled this way.  For example
<chunk class=anonymous><title/file write3/
{F write(vs:"This is "#1#' And '#
            ("now a float: "#2.0)#"\n")}
</chunk>
	<Index class=module/Open<And>file<And>write/
	writes a nested virtual string containing integers, atoms, strings and
	floats to the file.  Even the filename argument of the <<init>> method
	of class <<Open.file>> is allowed to be a virtual string.  For more
	information on virtual strings see <Ptr to="section.data.virtualstrings">.
      <P>
	If you type the Unix command
	<Code display proglang=sh/<Span class=index/cat/ ours.txt/
	or the Windows command
	<Code display proglang=sh/type ours.txt/
	to a shell, you see the content of <File/ours.txt/ printed to
	standard output.
    <SubSection>
      <Title/Exceptions/
      <P>
	Functionality provided by the class <<Open.file>> relies on operating
	system services.  These services might report exceptions, these
	exceptions are then raised as &Oz; exceptions.
      <P>
	For example, trying to open a non existing file raises an exception.
	Operating system dependent exceptions can be caught as follows:
<chunk class=anonymous><title/file catch/
try
   _={New Open.file init(name:'not-existing')}
catch system(os(A W I S) ...) then
   {Browse os(category:    A
	      what:        W
              number:      I
              description: S)}
end
</chunk>
	where <<A>> is an atom describing the category of the error
	(&eg;, <<os>> or <<host>>), <<W>> the system call that raised the exception (as string), <<I>>&nbsp;is the operating system
	dependent error number, and <<S>> is a string describing the error.
      <P>
	Besides of operating system exceptions, the methods of the class
	<<Open.file>> can raise two different exceptions themselves:
	<List enum>
	  <Item>
	    An exception is raised when an object is initialized twice.
	    This exception can be caught as follows:
<<<try
   &ellipsis; % Initialize twice
catch system(open(alreadyInitialized O M) ...) then
   &ellipsis;
end>>>
	    Here <<O>> is the object that has been tried to be initialized
	    twice by applying it to the method&nbsp;<<M>>.
	  <Item>
	    An exception is raised when a message other than <<close>> is
	    executed by an already closed file object.  This exception can
	    be caught as follows:
<<<try
   &ellipsis; % Apply closed object
catch system(open(alreadyClosed O M) ...) then
   &ellipsis;
end>>>
	    Here <<O>> is the object that has been closed already and <<M>>
	    the message <<O>> has been applied to.

    <Title/Example: Expanding TAB Characters/
    <P>
      Suppose we want to read a file, expand all <Name type=char/TAB/
      characters to space characters, and write the expanded lines to
      another file.  The program which implements this task is shown in
      <Ptr to="program.expand">.
      <Figure class=program id="program.expand">
	<Caption/The <<Expand>> procedure./
<chunk class=anonymous><title/Expand1/
local
   fun {Insert N Is}
      if N>0 then {Insert N-1 & |Is} else Is end
   end
   fun {Scan Is Tab N}
      case Is of nil then nil
      [] I|Ir then
         case I 
         of &\t then M=Tab-(N mod Tab) in {Insert M {Scan Ir Tab M+N}}
         [] &\n then I|{Scan Ir Tab 0}
         [] &\b then I|{Scan Ir Tab {Max 0 N-1}}
         else I|{Scan Ir Tab N+1}
         end
      end
   end
in
   proc {Expand Tab IN ON}
      IF={New Open.file init(name:IN)} 
      OF={New Open.file init(name:ON flags:[write create truncate])}
      Is
   in
      {IF read(list:Is size:all)}    {IF close}
      {OF write(vs:{Scan Is Tab 0})} {OF close}
   end
end
</chunk>
      </figure>

      The file with name <<IN>> is opened for reading.  After reading the
      entire file into the list <<Is>>, the file and the associated object
      are closed.  Remember that reading the entire file is obtained by giving
      <<all>> as the value for feature <<size>>.
    <P>
      The expansion of <Name type=char/TAB/ characters is done in the function
      <<Scan>>.  It takes as input parameters the list of characters <<Is>>,
      the <<Tab>>, and the current position <<N>> in the current line.
    <P>
      The outer <<case>> of <<Scan>> figures out whether there are characters
      to process.  If the next character to process is a <Name type=char/TAB/
      character, enough space characters to reach the next multiple of
      <<TabStop>> are inserted.  This is performed by the self explanatory
      function <<Insert>>.
    <P>
      A newline character resets the position&nbsp;<<N>> to zero.  The
      position is decremented whenever a backspace character is encountered.
      Any other character increments the position.
    <P>
      A second file is opened for writing (indicated by <<write>>).  If a file
      with name <<ON>> does not exist, it is created (indicated by <<create>>).
      Otherwise the already existing file is truncated to length zero
      (indicated by <<truncate>>) and rewritten.  The expanded string is
      written to this file.
    <P>
      The file and its associated file object are closed after writing the
      expanded list of characters to it.
