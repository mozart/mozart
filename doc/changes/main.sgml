    <Abstract>
      This documents gives a brief overview of the
changes between different Mozart versions. In
particular, it lists the changes from
      Oz 2.0 (and its implementation DFKI Oz) to Oz 3.0 (and its
      implementation Mozart).

      <title/Changes between Mozart 1.0.1 and Mozart 1.1.0/

      <p>
        Mozart 1.1.0 is a maintenance
        release that features a completely new and
        improved implementation of pickling and a
        major
        improvement of the
        constraint programming primitives.

        <subsection><title/Pickling/

        <p>
Due to some redesign of the instruction set and the pickling
algorithm, the pickle format changed between Mozart 1.0.1 and
Mozart 1.1.0.  A conversion tool has been made available however,
see <Ptr.Extern to="ozdoc:tools" key="chapter.convert"> for
documentation.
        </p>

        <subsection>
          <title/Constraint Programming/

        <p>
        <list>
         <entry>General improvements
         <item>
One of the main achievements in the 1.1.0 release is a fairly complete
overhaul of the constraint programming functionality in Mozart. This
makes the system leaner with respect to both code size and memory
requirements and several even severe bugs have been fixed. In average,
the refurbishment buys you a 20% speedup on constraint applications (up
to 40% in rare cases).

         <entry>Constructive disjunction removed
         <item>
            That's basically just for the records:
            nobody used it. Since it was complicated and a constant
            source of problems it has been
            removed. In the rare case that you
            used constructive disjunction, contact
            us for help.

         <entry><<FD>> and <<FS>> synchronization behavior corrected
         <item>
            All <<FD>> and <<FS>> propagators now
            conform to their documentation as it
            comes  to synchronization on their
            arguments. Mozart 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 were
            buggy in that execution did not block
            even though the propagators required
            their arguments to be finite domain or
            finite set variables. Watch out! In
            case your scripts that use finite
            domain or finite set propagators just
            block (they show a light (ugly) green
            color in the Oz Explorer) this is a
            likely cause! Fixing is easy: just
            make sure that all variables supplied
            to propagators are in fact constrained
            to be finite domains or finite sets.

         <entry><<Space>> and <<RecordC>> are
                system modules
         <item>
            To achieve better factorization of
            constraint programming support in
            Mozart all constraint programming
            modules are system modules rather than
            modules in the base environment. This
            results in a much smaller memory
            footprint of the Mozart engine in case
            the constraint programming facilities
            are not needed.

        </list>

        <subsection>
          <title/Distribution/

<p>
The distribution layer of Mozart has problems with fire-walls. From our
point of view fire-walls defines all sub nets that restrict their
traffic in some way. It has been impossible to connect to oz sites
through any kind of fire-walls up till now. A naive solution is included
in this release. It will only enable connections through the simplest of
fire walls, but that is better than nothing.  We are working on a more
general solution that will enable our sites to work over more complex
fire-walls.
</p>
<p>
There were problems related to the shortcoming of fire-walls. When a
Mozart sites needs to communicate it will try to open a connection. If
it fails to reach the desired site it will time-out and retry unless it
can deduce that the destination site is dead. The site will continue
trying to open the connection until it succeeds or finds the site dead.
This behavior can disturb fire-walls a lot. The time-out is now growing
with a growth factor. There is now a way to alter the start time-out
value, the growth factor and the timeout ceiling.
</p>


        <subsection>
          <title/Documentation/

          <p>
          <list>
          <entry>Global Index
          <item>The online documentation has been provided with a new index
that encompasses all index entries from the individual
documents.  It can be reached from the main documentation
page, either using the link in the margin or the link
under the Getting Started/Documentation
          header. Caveat: Not all documents have a
          useful index yet!

          <entry>Postscript and PDF
          <item> Is available now.
          </list>

        <subsection><title/Support for loops/
          <p>
In order to provide convenient syntax for loops, 2 new keywords have
been introduced: <code/for/ and <code/do/.  This is an incompatible
change.  Check your code: you must now quote every occurrence of
<q/for/ and <q/do/.  Support for loops is still
preliminary.  The general syntax is:
<code display>for ?{Iterators} do ... end</code>
where ?{Iterators} is a sequence of 1 or more iterators.  Supported
iterators are &eg;
<code display/X in L/
for iterating over the elements of a list
<code display/X in I..J/
for iterating from integer <code/I/ to <code/J/.  The loop terminates
as soon as one iterator runs out.
The complete documentation is available in <ptr.extern
to="ozdoc:loop"></p>

        <SubSection>
          <Title/Compiler Macro Names/
          <P>
            The Mozart compiler defines macro names to identify the version
            of the system that is running (see <Ptr.Extern to="ozdoc:compiler"
            key="section.macronames">).  These used to be
            <Code display proglang=oz>Oz_1   Oz_1_0   Oz_1_0_1</Code>
            for Mozart&nbsp;1.0.1, but to avoid clashes with the macro
            names provided by DFKI Oz, they are now
            <Code display proglang=oz
            >Mozart_1   Mozart_1_1   Mozart_1_1_0</Code>

         <title/General Changes/

      <subsection id="section.m100.general.modules">
        <title/Functors and Modules/

        <p>
          Mozart now comes with a powerful internet-based module
          system that supports lazy loading, native modules and
          more. For an introduction see <ptr.extern
          to="ozdoc:apptut">.

        <p>
          To make best use of the new module system, the previous Oz
          Standard Modules have been split into the <em/base
          environment/ and the <em/system modules/. The compiler
          always provides the base environment, it contains all
          operations working on data structures like records, lists,
          and so on. For more information see <ptr.extern
          to="ozdoc:base">.

        <p>
          All remaining modules (including the constraint programming
          support) are now provided as system modules that are subject
          to import in functor definitions. The system modules are
          described in <ptr.extern to="ozdoc:system">.

        <p>
          The Oz Programming Environment however still follows the
          design to ease explorative development. For that reason all
          system modules are still available in the Oz Programming
          Environment. The Environment nicely exemplifies the merits
          of the new module system: while providing all system modules
          the Environment starts in a fraction of a second by taking
          advantage of dynamic linking.

      <subsection id="section.m100.general.app">
        <title/Applications/

        <p>
          The rudimentary standalone application support available in
          DFKI Oz has been replaced by powerful abstractions and
          command line tools (see <ptr.extern to="ozdoc:tools">) to
          support different aspects of application programming. In
          fact, a new tutorial (see <ptr.extern to="ozdoc:apptut">)
          is entirely devoted to application programming with Oz and
          Mozart.

    <section id="section.m100.syntax" proglang=oz>
      <Title/Syntax Improvements/
      <P>
        Mozart implements the language Oz&nbsp;3, as opposed to
        DFKI Oz&nbsp;2, which implemented Oz&nbsp;2.  This chapter
        summarizes language changes between Oz&nbsp;2 and Oz&nbsp;3,
        of which most are only of syntactical nature.
      <subsection>
        <Title/Conditionals/
        <P>
          The <<case>> keyword used to introduce one of two conditionals:
          the boolean or the pattern matching conditional.  To adapt to
          common intuitions, the syntax and semantics have been changed.
        <Para class=apropos><Title/Boolean Conditionals/
          The boolean conditional is now written as
          <<<if ?{E} then ?{SE1} else ?{SE2} end>>>
          If the construct is statement position, the <<else ?{SE2}>> part
          is optional and defaults to <<else skip>>.
        <P>
          Since the <<if>> keyword is now used for boolean conditionals,
          the former (and seldom used) <<if>> conditional has been renamed
          to <<cond>>.  There is no <<elsecond>> to replace <<elseif>>.
        <Para class=apropos><Title/Pattern-Matching/
          The <<case ?{E} of &ellipsis; end>> conditional retains its syntax
          but changes its semantics.  Where formerly logic (dis-)entailment
          was used to match the value against a pattern, now a series of
          sequential tests is performed.  This makes no difference if the
          match is entailed.  Disentailment, however, may remain undiscovered
          and the thread block, &eg;, in:
          <<<case f(a b) of f(X X) then &ellipsis; end>>>
        <P>
          Furthermore, the box <<[]>> separating pattern-matching clauses
          now also has sequential semantics, and is thus equivalent to the
          now deprecated, though still allowed, <<elseof>>.
        <P>
          <<elseif>> and <<elsecase>> may still be freely intermixed within
          <<if>> and <<case>> conditionals.
      <subsection>
        <Title/Functors/
        <P>
          To accomodate modular application development, a module system
          has been designed.  The language itself supports the definition
          of <Em/functors/, from which modules can be obtained via linking.
      <subsection>
        <Title/Exceptions/
        <P>
          The construct <<raise ?{E1} with ?{E2} end>> has been removed.
          This was an experimental feature that has been found to be
          rarely used.
      <subsection>
        <Title/Keywords/
        <Para class=apropos><Title/New Keywords/
          Due to syntax changes, Oz&nbsp;3 has the following keywords, which
          thus cannot be used as unquoted atoms any more:
          <Table>
            <TR>
              <TD/<<at>>/<TD/<<cond>>/<TD/<<define>>/<TD/<<export>>/
            <TR>
              <TD/<<functor>>/<TD/<<import>>/<TD/<<prepare>>/<TD/<<require>>/
          </Table>
        <Para class=apropos><Title/Removed Keywords/
          The following keywords have been returned atom status and do
          not count as keywords any more:
          <Table>
            <TR>
              <TD/<<with>>/
          </Table>
      <subsection>
        <Title/Core Expansion/
        <P>
          The core expansion of Oz&nbsp;3 as defined in
          <Ptr.Extern to="ozdoc:notation"> does not give core variables
          (written without backquotes) normal variable status any more,
          but considers them variables statically bound within a runtime
          library environment.  This means that the used backquote
          variables are not part of the Base Environment.
        <P>
          This was necessary because the old design compromised language
          security.

    <section id="section.m100.base">
      <title/Base/
      <p>
        This chapter documents the changes that have taken place in the
        Base Environment (formerly Standard Modules) and base language.

      <subsection class=unumbered>
        <title/Classes with Multiple Inheritance/

        <p>
          Multiple inheritance does not provide for automatic
          conflict resolution. If a conflicting method definition
          arises in multiple inheritance, the
          conflict <em/must/ be resolved by overriding the
          method. Otherwise, an exception is raised.
        <p>
          A conflicting method definition arises if a method is
          defined by more than one class. For example,
<<<class A meth m skip end end
class B meth m skip end end
class C from A B end>>>
          raises an exception (the old model would silently pick the
          method from <<B>>), since both <<A>> and <<B>> define the
          method <<m>>. The only way to fix this is by overriding <<m>>
          when creating class <<C>>:
          <<<class C from A B meth m skip end end>>>
        <p>
          Features and attributes are handled identically. For a
          more thorough discussion see <ptr.extern
          to="ozdoc:tutorial" key="chapter.classes">.

      <subsection class=unumbered>
        <title/The Modules <<Class>> and <<Object>>/

        <p>
          The modules <<Class>> and <<Object>> underwent a major
          redesign and re-implementation. The redesign became
          necessary because the old modules compromised both system
          and application security. Programming abstractions that
          support common patterns of object oriented programming are
          described in the module <<ObjectSupport>> (see <ptr.extern
          to="ozdoc:system" key="chapter.objectsupport">).


      <subsection id="section.m100.base.chunks">
        <title/Chunks/

        <p>
          The procedures <<Chunk.hasFeature>> and <<Chunk.getFeature>>
          are gone. Just use <<HasFeature>> and <<Value.'.'>> (see
          <ptr.extern to="ozdoc:base" key="chapter.values">).

      <title/System Modules/


      <subsection id="section.m100.system.search">
        <title/Search Engines renamed/

        <p>
          The engines that used to be available by <<SearchOne>>,
          <<SearchAll>>, and <<SearchBest>> are now available under
          <<Search.base.one>>, <<Search.base.all>>, and
          <<Search.base.best>> (for more information see <ptr.extern
          to="ozdoc:system" key="chapter.search">). However in the Oz
          Programming Interface <<SearchOne>>,
          <<SearchAll>>, and <<SearchBest>> are still available for
          convenience.

      <subsection id="section.m100.system.schedule">
        <title/Scheduling support moved/

        <p>
          Scheduling support is now provided by the system module
          <<Schedule>> rather than <<FD.schedule>>. See also
          <ptr.extern to="ozdoc:fdt" key="chapter.scheduling">  and
          <ptr.extern to="ozdoc:system" key="chapter.schedule">.

      <subsection id="section.m100.system.property">
        <title/<<System.get>> and <<System.set>>/

        <p>
          <<System.get>> and <<System.set>> have been replaced by more
          powerful procedures that are available in the module
          <<Property>>, which is described in
          <ptr.extern to="ozdoc:system" key="chapter.property">.

      <subsection id="section.m100.system.vstoval">
        <title/<<System.valueToVirtualString>> and <<System.virtualStringToValue>>/

        <p>
          <<System.valueToVirtualString>> and
          <<System.virtualStringToValue>> are now available as
<<Value.toVirtualString>> (see
          <ptr.extern to="ozdoc:base" key="chapter.values">) and
<<Compiler.virtualStringToValue>> (see
          <ptr.extern to="ozdoc:compiler"
          key="section.api.module">). In particular,
          <<Compiler.virtualStringToValue>> is a full featured and
          stable replacement for the ad-hoc
          <<System.virtualStringToValue>>.

    <section id="section.m100.tools">
      <Title/Tools/
      <subsection>
        <Title/New Tools/
        <P>
          Mozart comes with (improved) versions of the tools that
          came with DFKI Oz.  Additionally, it has:
          <List>
            <Item>a profiler, described in <Ptr.Extern to="ozdoc:profiler">,
              and
            <Item>a source-level debugger called Ozcar, described in
              <Ptr.Extern to="ozdoc:ozcar">.
          </List>
      <subsection>
        <Title/Compiler/
        <P>
          The compiler has been reimplemented in Oz.  This means that an
          arbitrary number of compiler objects may be instantiated on the
          same VM.  Linguistic reflection is thus fully supported through
          an API that offers unrestricted access to the compiler's
          functionality, documented in <Ptr.Extern to="ozdoc:compiler">.
      <subsection>
        <Title/Gump/
        <P>
          Gump, the frontend generator for Oz, is no longer a stand-alone
          tool that must be invoked on a file, but is closely integrated
          into the Oz compiler.  It is now sufficient to set a switch:
          <<<\switch +gump>>>
          and full Gump functionality as described in <Ptr.Extern
          to="ozdoc:gump"> is available within the language.  Furthermore,
          support for Gump under Windows has been greatly improved.
