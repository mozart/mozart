<TITLE>Modules and Interfaces</TITLE>

<P>Modules, also known as packages, are collection of procedures and
other values<NOTE FOOT>Classes, objects, etc.</NOTE> that are
constructed together to provide certain related functionality. A
module typically has a number of private procedures that are not
visible outside the module and a number of interface procedures that
provide the external services of the module. 
In Oz there is syntactic support for module specification.
The concept used is called <EM> functor </EM>.
A functor is an expression that specifies the components of a module.
The Mozart system converts a functor to a module with the help of
a module manager.

<P>Let us first see what a module is, and then look to a corresponding
functor that specifies the module. In general a module is
a bunch of locally defined entities, e.g. procedures, objects, 
accessible through a record interface.
Assume that we would
like to construct a module called <<List>> that provides a number of
interface procedures for appending, sorting and testing membership of
lists. This would look as follows.

<<<
declare List in
local 
   proc {Append ... }  ... end
   proc {MergeSort ...} ... end
   proc {Sort ... } ... {MergeSort ...} ... end
   proc {Member ...} ... end
 in
   List = 'export'(append: Append
                   sort: Sort
                   member: Member
                   ... )
end
>>>

<P>Access to <<Append>> procedure outside of the module <<List >>is
done by using the field <<append>> from the <EM>record</EM> <<List>>:
<<List.append>>. Notice that in the above example the procedure
<<MergeSort>> is private to the module. Most of the base library modules of
Mozart follow the above structure.
The above module can be created from a functor that looks as follows:
<<<
functor 
export 
  append:Append
  sort:Sort
  member:Member
  ...
define
   proc {Append ... }  ... end
   proc {MergeSort ...} ... end
   proc {Sort ... } ... {MergeSort ...} ... end
   proc {Member ...} ... end
end
>>>
Assuming that this functor is stored, somehow, on the file '/home/xxx/list.ozf', the module can be created as follows:
<<<
declare [List]= {Module.link ['/home/xxx/list.ozf']}
>>>
<P> <<Module.link/2>> is a function defined in the module <<Module>>
that takes a list of functors, links them together, returns 
a corresponding list of modules.

<P>Functors may also have import declarations. If you want to import a
system module you can just state the name of its functor. On the
other-hand importing a user-defined module requires stating the URL of
the file where the functor is stored.  

<P> Consider the following functor.  
<<< 
functor 
import
   Browser 
   FO at 'file:///home/seif/FileOperations.ozf' 
define
   {Browser.browse {FO.countLines '/etc/passwd'}} 
end >>> 

<P> The <<import>>
declaration imports the system module <<Browser>>, and uses the
procedure <<Browser.browse>>. It also imports the module <<FO>>
specified by the functor stored in the file 
<<'/home/seif/FileOperations.ozf'>>, and calls the procedure
<<FO.countLines>> which counts the number of lines in a file
given as argument. This functor is defined for its effect, therefore
it does not export any interface. When this functor is linked
the statement between <<define ... end>> is executed.
 
<P CLASS=WARNING>Given 
a file <<'x.oz'>> defining a functor, you may
create the corresponding functor <<'x.ozf'>> from
your shell by typing the command:
<<< ozc -c x.ozf >>>
