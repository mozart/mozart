  <Title/Compiler Engines/
  <P>
    A compiler engine is an instance of the final class <<Compiler.engine>>:
    <Code display>E = {New Compiler.engine init()}</Code>
    Each instance of this class is an active object encapsulating the
    state of a compiler, consisting of a list of defined macro names,
    the state of a number of boolean compiler switches, an environment,
    and the query queue.  These are described in the following sections.
  <Section>
    <Title/Macro Definitions/
    <P>
      The list of macro names currently defined is used by the parser to
      resolve macro directives such as <<\ifdef>>.  Note that the scope
      of the <<\define>> and <<\undef>> macro directives is limited to a
      single compilation and does not update this list.
    <P>
      Initially, this list only consists of macro names describing the
      Oz version number, &eg;, when running Oz&nbsp;3.0.9, the list is
      <<['Oz_3' 'Oz_3_0' 'Oz_3_0_9']>>.
  <Section>
    <Title/Compiler Switches/
    <P>
      The current state of the compiler switches is given by a mapping
      from switch names to boolean values.  Each compiler engine manages
      a stack of switch states, the top element of which is taken as the
      active state.  This is useful to temporarily escape into a different
      mode of compiler operation, execute some queries and pop back to the
      saved state.
    <P>
      The available switches and their effects on the compilation process
      are described in detail in <Ptr to="section.reference.switches">.
  <Section>
    <Title/The Environment/
    <P>
      An environment is a mapping from variable print names to arbitrary
      Oz values.  Initially, the environment of a newly created Compiler
      Engine contains the variables declared by the Oz Standard Modules as
      well as the following backquote variable:
      <List>
	<Entry><<`Compiler`>>
	<Item>
	  <P.silent><!--**-->
	    A reference to the Compiler Engine itself.
	</List>
    <P>
      Environments are first class; that is, they may be enquired,
      set or extended by records whose features are valid variable
      print names, &eg;, <<env('Show': System.show)>>.
  <Section>
    <Title/The Query Queue/
    <P>
      The entries in the query queue are executed sequentially by
      the object's internal thread.  A new query can be enqueued by
      <Code display>{E enqueue(M)}</Code>
      This operation blocks until the query <<M>> and its input arguments
      are fully determined, then either raises an exception if it is an
      unknown or ill-typed query, or immediately returns.  Internally,
      each enqueued query is assigned a unique identification number which
      is obtained by adding an output argument to the <<enqueue>> message:
      <Code display>{E enqueue(M ?Id)}</Code>
      The identification may be used later to remove the query from the
      queue (unless its execution has already begun or terminated):
      <Code display>{E dequeue(Id)}</Code>
    <P>
      The execution of the current query may be abandoned by use of the
      <<interrupt()>> message and the whole remaining queue may be flushed
      via <<clearQueue()>>.
    <P>
      The argument to enqueue may also be a <Em>list</Em> of queries:
      These are guaranteed to be executed in sequence without other
      queries interleaving.  The second argument then returns a list of
      identification numbers.
    <P>
      Some queries request state information from the compiler engine.
      The corresponding output variables only become bound when the query
      is actually executed.  If binding an output variable raises an
      exception, an error is reported through the registered interfaces
      (see <Ptr to="chapter.interfaces">).
    <P>
      The queries understood by the compiler are listed in <Ptr
      to="section.reference.queries">.
