<Chapter id="Chapter.Finalize">
  <Title/Memory Management: <<Finalize>>/
  <p>The finalization facility gives the programmer the ability to
process an Oz value when it is discovered (during garbage collection)
that it has otherwise become unreachable.  This is often used to
release native resources held or encapsulated by said value.</p>
  <p>Native functors and extension classes make it very easy to extend
Oz with new interfaces to arbitrary resources.  Typically, the access
to a resource will be encapsulated into a data-structure that is an
instance of an extension class and we would like the resource to be
automatically released when the data-structure is no longer being
referenced and can be garbage collected.  For example:
<list>
      <item>we may encapsulate a handle to access a database:
when the handle is garbage collected, we would like the connection to
the database to be automatically closed.
      <item>we may encapsulate a pointer to malloc'ed memory,
e.g. for a large bitmap to be manipulated by native DLLs: when this is
no longer referenced, we would like the memory to be automatically
freed.
    </list>
This is the purpose of <em/finalization/: to execute a cleanup action
when a computational object is no longer referenced. The Oz
finalization facility was inspired by the article <ref.extern to=
"ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/pub/scheme-repository/doc/pubs/guardians.ps.gz"
>Guardians in a Generation-Based Garbage Collector</ref.extern>
(R. Kent Dybvig, Carl Bruggeman, David Eby, June 1993).
<list>
      <entry/<code/Finalize.register/
<index/<code/Finalize/<and><code/register///
      <synopsis/<code/{Finalize.register ?+{Value} ?+{Handler}}//
      <item>A ?_{Value} that must be finalized is registered with
the finalization guardian together with its finalization ?_{Handler}.
When this ?_{Value} is no longer referenced except by the guardian,
<code/{?_{Handler} ?_{Value}}/ is eventually executed in a new
thread.  We say <em/eventually/ because the finalization thread is
subject to the same fair scheduling as any other thread. Note that
the ?_{Value} has still not be garbage collected; only at the next
garbage collection after the call to ?_{Handler} has returned, and
?_{Value} is no longer referenced at all, not even by the guardian,
will it really be garbage collected.  It is possible for a ?_{Value} to be
registered multiple times.  It is also possible for the ?_{Handler} to
decide to re-register the value.
        <p>To be more precise: the guardian maintains a list of
pairs, each consisting of a ?_{Value} and a ?_{Handler}: this is the
guardian list.  When a garbage collection occurs, the guardian
determines which values are no longer referenced except through this
list.  The corresponding pairs are removed from the guardian list and
put into a finalization list.  This finalization list is then
processed in a new thread by the finalization handler (see below).
      <entry/<code/Finalize.setHandler/
<index/<code/Finalize/<and><code/setHandler///
      <synopsis><code>{Finalize.setHandler ?+{P/1}}</code></synopsis>
      <item>This sets the finalization handler.  The default
finalization handler simply loops through the finalization list and
invokes <code/{?_{Handler} ?_{Value}}/ for each pair of ?_{Value} and
?_{Handler} in it.
      <entry/<code/Finalize.everyGC/
<index/<code/Finalize/<and><code/everyGC///
      <synopsis><code>{Finalize.everyGC ?+{P/0}}</code></synopsis>
      <item>This simply registers a nullary procedure to be invoked
after each garbage collection.  Note that you cannot rely on how soon
after the garbage collection this procedure will really be invoked: it
is in principle possible that the call may only be scheduled several
garbage collections later if the system has an incredibly large number
of live threads and generates tons of garbage.  It is instructive to
look at the definition of <code/EveryGC/:
<code display>
proc {EveryGC P}
   proc {DO _} {P} {Finalize.register DO DO} end
in {Finalize.register DO DO} end
</code>
in other words, we create a procedure <code/DO/ and register it using
itself as its own handler.  When invoked, it calls <code/P/ and
registers itself again.
