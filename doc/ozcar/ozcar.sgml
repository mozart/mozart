    <abstract>

      This manual describes Ozcar, a symbolic debugger which provides
      well known features like single stepping, breakpoints, and
      environment inspectation.  Moreover, it supports debugging of
      multiple threads; their concurrent behaviour can be observed and
      manipulated.

      <p>

      Ozcar has been smoothly integrated into the Oz Programming
      Interface. It can be started and stopped from within Emacs,
      which itself serves both as a source view manager, showing the
      current position in a debugged program by highlightening the
      corresponding source line, and as a breakpoint manager, allowing
      to set breakpoints at arbitrary source lines.

      <p>

      Finally, the application ozd is provided to debug standalone
      programs.

    <chapter>
      <title/Getting Started/
      <p>

      There are two ways in which Ozcar can be invoked. First, from
      within the OPI, second, from the Shell.

      <section>
        <title/Invocation from the OPI/
        <p>
        To start Ozcar from the OPI, you have to use the Emacs
        function <span proglang=elisp><<oz-debugger>></span> (<Key/C-c
        C-d/). Executed with prefix argument (<Key/C-u C-c C-d/), the
        Ozcar window gets closed again. Note, however, that this just
        suspends the debugger; after re-opening the window, you can
        continue debugging exactly where you stopped before,
        presupposing that all debugged threads are stopped (see
        single-stepping).

      <section>
        <title/Invocation from the Shell/
        <p>
        Another way of using Ozcar is to debug Oz applications.
        For this purpose, the program ozd is provided (which is an
        oz application itself, btw.). If you want to debug the
        application foo, you just type from the shell ozd foo. This
        starts an Oz engine, which in turn starts Ozcar and Emacs.

    <chapter>
      <title/Ozcar's main components/
        <p>

        <ptr to=ozcar.initial> shows the main window after Ozcar has
        been invoked for the first time.

        <figure class="picture" id=ozcar.initial>
          <caption/The main window/
          <p><picture.extern gif to="ozcar-initial.gif">
        </figure>

      <section>
        <title/Thread View/
        <p>

        On the left, there is a window labeled <def>Thread
        Forest</def>. Here you can see all the threads which are
        currently attached (see attach). The hierarchical dependencies
        are illustrated by printing all threads as nodes of a tree:
        Children are always inserted below their parent, indented to
        the right.

        <p>

        Different node chapes correspond to different thread states:
        The state of a thread can be seen as a pair of two values.
        The first one determines if the thread is currently stopped by
        the debugger. Nodes of stopped threads are printed with a
        normal font, running threads are printed in bold face. The
        second component of the pair can have one of the following
        four states:

        <list>
          <entry>runnable
          <item>

          The thread is runnable. This means it can be scheduled by the
          virtual machine. Such a thread is printed in green.

          <entry>blocked
          <item>

          The thread waits for a synchronization condition. It cannot be
          scheduled by the virtual machine. Such a thread is printed in
          yellow.

          <entry>crashed
          <item>

          The thread got an unhandled exception. Such a thread is
          printed in red.

          <entry>dead
          <item>
          The thread is dead. Such a thread is printed in grey.

        </list>

        One thread (if there is any one attached) is the <def>selected
        thread</def>; its node is marked with an asterix. Some actions,
        like single stepping or selecting stack frames, are always
        relative to this thread. You can select a thread by clicking
        on it with the left mouse button or by using the left and
        right cursor keys.



      <section>
        <title/Stack View/
        <p>

        Right beside the thread window, there is another window
        labeled <def>Stack</def>. It prints the stack of the currently
        selected thread. Beware: the topmost frame is displayed at the
        bottom. The procedures arguments are printed in bold face and
        can be further investigated (using the Browser tool) by
        clicking on them.

        <p>

        One frame is the <def>selected frame</def>. It is displayed
        white on blue. Initially, the top frame is selected
        implicitely, without being marked in any way.  You can
        navigate through the stack by clicking on a frame (search for
        a position within the line where no arguments are displayed!)
        or by using the up and down cursor keys.

      <section>
        <title/Variables View/
        <p>

        Below the stack window, there are two windows, labeled
        <def>Local Variables</def> and <def>Global Variables</def>, to
        display information about local and global variables of the
        currently selected stack frame. The local environment is
        sorted by introduction order of the variables in the source
        code, the global environment is sorted alphabetically. As with
        the arguments in the stack window, you can click on the (bold
        faced) values of the variables to browse them.

      <section>
        <title/Status Line/
        <p>

        At the bottom of the main window, there is a <def>Status
        Line</def> which is used to display miscellaneous useful
        information.

      <Chapter>
        <title/A first interaction
        <p>

        So, how can Ozcar actually be used? Consider the following
        small program:

<<<local
   S = 'hello'
in
   {Show S # ' world!'}
end>>>

        <Para class=apropos><Title/Attaching a thread/
        Let's check how this code is executed by the virtual machine
        of mozart&emdash;step by step. The default behaviour of Ozcar
        is to <q>catch</q> all threads which are created by Emacs
        queries, so all you have to do in order to debug the code
        is to feed it in the normal way, for example using the
        Emacs function <span proglang=elisp><<oz-feed-paragraph>></span>
        (<Key/C-c C-p/). You will see Ozcar printing the following:

        <figure class="picture" id=ozcar.hello>
          <caption/The main window after feeding the program/
          <p><picture.extern gif to="ozcar-hello.gif">
        </figure>

        First, you are informed through the status line, that there
        has been attached a new thread with thread number 96, and this
        thread was selected automatically. In the thread forest
        window, you see a single, bold faced node, labeled with the
        thread number. The executing thread has been stopped directly
        after its creation, so the stack window displays a single
        stack frame, containing the first application of the program,
        <<S = 'hello'>>, which is, translated into core syntax,
        <<{Value.'='_ hello}>>. The variable name seems to be lost,
        and in fact, it is, at least in the stack window. But, there
        is no need to despair, we have our variable windows, and
        indeed, the variable <<S>> can be found in the local
        environment, still unbound (visualized by the underscore
        char). The right arrow at the beginning of the line in
        the stack window means: You are about to apply the
        function, but you haven't yet! The number beside the arrow
        means: This is stack frame number one.

        <p>

        In Emacs, the source line which contains
        <<{Value.'='_ hello}>> is highlighted, like this:

        <figure class="picture">
        <caption/Emacs shows the exact position of the stopped thread/
          <p><picture.extern gif to="ozcar-hello3.gif">
        </figure>

        <Para class=apropos><Title/Single Stepping/ Now, how can we
        apply the function <<Value.'='>>? One way is to use the mouse,
        clicking on the <picture.extern inline gif to="step.gif">
        button. This means: Do exactly one step. What happens, is,
        that in the stack window you can read

        <picture.extern gif to="ozcar-hello2.gif">
