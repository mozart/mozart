  <Title/Building Mozart for Windows/
  <P>
    This chapter describes how to build Mozart for Windows.  We describe
    the tools used in the build process and how to obtain them.  We explain
    how to configure and build both the packages Mozart depends upon and
    Mozart itself.  We conclude by a description of how to create an
    installer, should you want to do so.
  <Section id="section.cygwin.environment">
    <Title/Setting up the Build Environment/
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Cygwin/
      From Version 1.2.1, Mozart can be built natively under Windows using
      the Cygwin environment.  Cygwin is a Unix environment for Windows.
      In particular, it provides a C++ compiler (gcc), a Bourne-compatible
      shell (bash), and all the usual Unix command line tools.  Cygwin can
      be obtained for free at <Ref.Extern to="http://www.cygwin.com/"
      >http://www.cygwin.com/</Ref.Extern>.
    <P>
      Take yourself to a Windows machine (Windows XP Professional, Windows
      2000 or Windows NT&nbsp;4 are preferred, though others may work) and
      install Cygwin (full installation preferred), then start a shell.
      Make sure that <<uname -r>> displays at least version 1.3.5.  It is
      a good idea that you familiarize yourself with this environment, as
      you'll be using it for a while before your Mozart build is finished.
      I recommend that you read the <Ref.Extern
      to="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/cygwin-ug-net.html"/<Q
      /Cygwin User's Guide//.
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Cygwin Basics/
      As you will have seen on the Cygwin web site, Cygwin actually consists
      of two parts:  A DLL providing a significant part of the Unix API,
      and a collection of tools.  The tools we need, the DLL we do not want.
      By default, all executables created by gcc require the Cygwin DLL
      (<File/cygwin1.dll/).  This DLL provides the Unix emulation
      functionality, such as support for Cygwin-style file names (you
      do not know what this is?  Read the User's Guide!) and mount points.
      If we built Mozart against this DLL, then we would need to ship it
      with Mozart (so that Mozart works on systems which do not have Cygwin
      installed).  We do not want to ship it, and we do not need the Unix
      emulation, and we want to be a <Q/native/ Windows application, so
      we will use the <<-mno-cygwin>> flag to gcc throughout the build
      process.  This flag in fact instructs gcc to act as a cross-compiler:
      the host environment being Windows with Cygwin, the target environment
      being native Windows.  This cross-compiler is called <Ref.Extern
      to="http://www.mingw.org/"/MinGW/, which is also available as a
      standalone product and as a cross-compiler hosted on Linux.
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Headers and Libraries/
      Object files and libraries built for Cygwin do not work with object
      files and libraries built for MinGW.  Instead of the header files in
      <File>/usr/include/</File> and the libraries in <File>/usr/lib/</File>,
      <<gcc -mno-cygwin>> therefore uses the header files from <File
      >/usr/include/mingw/</File> and the libraries from <File
      >/usr/lib/mingw/</File>.  Instead of the Cygwin DLL, MinGW links
      executables against the Microsoft Visual C/C++ Runtime (<File
      /msvcrt.dll/), which we can redistribute with Mozart.
    <P>
      Mozart requires several packages.  Even though some of these are
      provided with Cygwin, they are built for Cygwin, and we need them
      built for MinGW.  So before we can actually start on the Mozart
      sources, we will build these additional packages.  Thankfully we
      need to do this only once.
  <Section id="section.cygwin.packages">
    <Title/Acquiring the Required Packages/
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Package Directory/
      We will install all our packages in a new directory we create
      especially for them.  Say this directory is <File>/opt/packages</File>.
      Whatever it is, we will refer to it as ?{packages} throughout this
      document.  Furthermore, we populate the ?{packages} directory with
      the following subdirectories:
      <Table>
        <TR><TH>Directory<TH>Purpose
        <TR><TD><File/dlls/<TD>For the Dynamically Linked Libraries (DLLs).
        <TR><TD><File/include/<TD>For the packages' C/C++ header files
          (<File/.h/).
        <TR><TD><File/lib/<TD>For the libraries (<File/.a/).
      </Table>
      Furthermore, we create a separate directory for the builds, for
      example, <File>/tmp/build</File>.  We will refer to this as ?{build}.
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Required Packages/
      The following table lists the packages we need, along with their
      versions and the place where they can be downloaded.
      <Table>
        <TR><TH>Package<TH>Version<TH>Location
        <TR><TD>GNU MP<TD>4.1.4

      Note that these are all source packages except for Tcl/Tk.  You'll
      soon find out why.
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Build Flags/
      The remainder of this chapter will use ?{CFLAGS} to indicate a
      meaningful set of flags for the C/C++ compilers.  For instance, you
      can use the following, which we used for the last releases:
      <<<-mno-cygwin -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -march=i586 -mcpu=i686>>>
      It is imperative that you include <<-mno-cygwin>>!
    <Para class=apropos><Title/A Note for the Lazy/
      There's some good news:  If you are lazy enough that you would
      trust the packages I built, you can just obtain a copy of my
      ?{packages} directory from <Ref.Extern
      to="http://www.mozart-oz.org/download/mozart-ftp/extras/packages.tgz"><File
      >http://www.mozart-oz.org/download/mozart-ftp/extras/packages.tgz</File
      ></Ref.Extern> and skip most of the following sections (in fact,
      all but those about the msvcrt and Emacs).  Be sure to adapt
      the included <File/tclConfig.sh/ and <File/tkConfig.sh/ files
      to reflect your system's paths!
    <SubSection>
      <Title/Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime/
      <P>
        This one is easy:  You already have it!  It is located in
        <<$SYSTEMROOT/system32/>> (at least under Windows 2000; if you're
        running 9x, then you'll have to locate it yourself).  So we just copy
        it to our ?{packages}<File>/dlls</File> directory:
        <<<cp $SYSTEMROOT/system32/msvcrt.dll ?{packages}/dlls>>>
    <SubSection>
      <Title/GNU MP/
      <P>
        Unpack it, configure it, build it, and install it thus:
<<<cd ?{build}
tar zxvf gmp-4.1.2.tar.gz
cd gmp-4.1.2
./configure --prefix=?{packages} --disable-shared CFLAGS="?{CFLAGS}"
make
make install>>>
      <P>
        You should end up with the following files:
        <Table>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/include/gmp.h</File>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/lib/libgmp.a</File>
        </Table>
    <SubSection>
      <Title/zlib/
      <P>
        Unpack it, configure it, build it, and install it thus:
<<<cd ?{build}
tar zxvf zlib.tar.gz
cd zlib-1.1.4
CFLAGS="?{CFLAGS}" ./configure --prefix=?{packages}
make
make install>>>
      <P>
        You should end up with the following files:
        <Table>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/include/zlib.h</File>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/include/zconf.h</File>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/lib/libz.a</File>
        </Table>
    <SubSection>
      <Title>Tcl/Tk</Title>
      <P>
        Install your Tcl/Tk distribution (for example, ActiveTcl).  Copy
        the following files and directories from the installed location:
        <Table>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/include/tcl.h</File>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/include/tclDecls.h</File>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/include/tclPlatDecls.h</File>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/include/tk.h</File>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/include/tkDecls.h</File>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/include/tkIntXlibDecls.h</File>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/include/tkPlatDecls.h</File>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/include/X11/*</File>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/lib/tk8.4/*</File>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/lib/tcl8.4/*</File>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/dlls/tcl84.dll</File>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/dlls/tclpip84.dll</File>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/dlls/tk84.dll</File>
        </Table>
        Unfortunately, Windows Tcl/Tk distributions come without the
        all-important <File/tclConfig.sh/ and <File/tkConfig.sh/ files,
        which we therefore have to create manually (directly in the
        ?{packages} directory).  <File/tclConfig.sh/ should have the
        following contents:
<<<# tclConfig.sh --
TCL_VERSION='8.4'
TCL_PREFIX='?{packages}'
TCL_LIBS=''
TCL_LIB_SPEC='?{packages}/dlls/tcl84.dll'>>>
        Whereas <File/tkConfig.sh/ ought to look like this:
<<<# tkConfig.sh --
TK_VERSION='8.4'
TK_PREFIX='?{packages}'
TK_LIBS=''
TK_LIB_SPEC='?{packages}/dlls/tk84.dll'
TK_XINCLUDES=''>>>
        (Don't forget to substitute your actual packages directory for
        ?{packages} in these files!)
    <SubSection>
      <Title/GDBM/
      <P>
        Unpack it thus:
<<<cd ?{packages}
tar zxvf gdbm-1.8.3.tar.gz
cd gdbm-1.8.3>>>
        GDBM does not compile out-of-the-box for MinGW, so we have to
        apply a patch.  Copy the file <Ref.Extern to="gdbm-1.8.3-patch.diff"
        /gdbm-1.8.3-patch.diff/, then patch it, configure it, build it,
        and install it thus:
<<<patch &lt; gdbm-1.8.3-patch.diff
CFLAGS="?{CFLAGS}" ./configure --disable-shared
make CFLAGS="?{CFLAGS}"
make prefix=?{packages} install>>>
      <P>
        You should end up with the following files:
        <Table>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/include/gdbm.h</File>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/lib/libgdbm.a</File>
        </Table>
    <SubSection>
      <Title/regex/
      <P>
        Unpack it thus:
<<<cd ?{packages}
tar zxvf regex-0.12.tar.gz
cd regex-0.12>>>
        Like GDBM, the regex package needs a patch <Ref.Extern
        to="regex-0.12-patch.diff"/regex-0.12-patch.diff/.  Patch the
        package, configure it, build it, and install it thus:
<<<patch &lt; regex-0.12-patch.diff
CFLAGS="?{CFLAGS}" ./configure --prefix=?{packages}
make CFLAGS="?{CFLAGS}"
make prefix=?{packages} install>>>
      <P>
        You should end up with the following files:
        <Table>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/include/regex.h</File>
          <TR><TD>?{packages}<File>/lib/libregex.a</File>
        </Table>
    <SubSection>
      <Title/Emacs/
      <P>
        You need an installed Emacs.  You can get it at <Ref.Extern
        to="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/"
        <File>http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/</File
        ></Ref.Extern>.  Unpack it somewhere, for example to
        <File>/cygdrive/c/Program\ Files/</File> and execute the
        <File/addpm.exe/ binary in the <File/bin/ subdirectory.
        We will refer to the directory where Emacs is installed
        as ?{emacs}.
      </P>
      <P>
        You really need to use the Emacs version you have installed in
        your Windows system. If you have Emacs installed along with
        cygwin, you have to change your PATH to build Mozart in order
        to find first the Emacs that it's installed for Windows. Be
        aware that the <code/configure/ script is not going to check
        whether you have Emacs installed in your system, but it will
        be necessary to build, so install it NOW!
      </P>
  <Section id="section.cygwin.building">
    <Title/Building Mozart/
    <P>
      Now we can get to the real thing.  Retrieve the sources from the CVS:
<<<cvs -d cvs.mozart-oz.org:/services/mozart/CVS get mozart
cvs -d cvs.mozart-oz.org:/services/mozart/CVS get mozart-stdlib>>>
      (specify <<-r mozart-1-3-0-fixes>> to get the fixes branch).
      See <Ref.Extern to="http://www.mozart-oz.org/download/view.cgi?action=cvs"
      >http://www.mozart-oz.org/download/view.cgi?action=cvs</Ref.Extern> for details
      about anonymous CVS.  Let ?{mozart} be the directory created by the
      first <<cvs get>> command and ?{stdlib} the one created by the second.
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Environment Variables/
      We need to start with a clean <Var type=env/PATH/, which in particular
      must not contain any Mozart installation.  The following works on my
      system:
      <<<export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:?{emacs}/bin:/cygdrive/c/WINNT/system32:/cygdrive/c/WINNT>>>
      Furthermore, we want to tell the configuration scripts where we
      placed our Windows DLLs:
      <<<export windlldir=?{packages}/dlls>>>
    <Para class=apropos><Title/The Fun Part/
      Say we want to install Mozart into directory ?{install}.
      Then we can configure, build, and install Mozart as follows:
<<<cd ?{build}
mkdir mozart-build
cd mozart-build
CXX=g++ ?{mozart}/configure \
    --prefix=?{install} \
    --with-inc-dir=?{packages}/include \
    --with-lib-dir=?{packages}/lib \
    --with-tcl=?{packages} \
    --with-tk=?{packages} \
    --disable-contrib-compat \
make bootstrap
make install>>>
      <<oztool>> (which is required for building some of the contributions)
      does not work if given a cygwin symbolic link to the executable
      it should run.  Currently cygwin has <<c++>> as a symbolic link to
      <<g++>>.  We get around this by setting <<CXX=g++>> during the
      configure process,  which will then choose <<g++>> as our default C++ compiler.

      <P>
      We will build the standard library in a different directory, but
      it will be installed in the same one where Mozart is. This is
      specified in during the configuration. Then we can configure,
      build, and install Mozart as follows:
<<<cd ?{build}
mkdir stdlib-build
cd stdlib-build
../?{stdlib}/configure --prefix=?{install}
make
make install>>>

      <P>
      A note on the configuration options:  Most of these should be clear,
      they simply convey to the configuration scripts the knowledge of where
      we placed our packages.  More information on configuration options
      can be found in <Ptr to="chapter.src.configure">.  We have to disable
      the <File/compat/ contrib because it does not build in bootstrap mode
      (yet).  This is why we have to build it separately once we have our
      installed system:
<<<cd ?{build}
mkdir compat-build
cd compat-build
export PATH=?{install}/bin:$PATH
CXX=g++ ?{mozart}/contrib/compat/configure --with-global-oz --prefix=?{install}
mkdir share
cp ?{build}/mozart-build/share/Makefile.boot share
make
make install>>>
      And yeah, verily, thus and so&emdash;we're done.
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Using Mozart/
      To use Mozart, you simply have to extend your <Var type=env/PATH/:
      <<<export PATH=?{install}/bin:$PATH>>>
      Then you can start <<oz>>, <<ozc>> and so on, as you would expect.
  <Section id="section.cygwin.documentation">
    <Title/Building Documentation/
    <P>
      Documentation currently cannot be built under Windows alone.  Luckily,
      this step is optional.  If you don't do it, then you simply have a
      system without documentation, but it runs.
    <P>
      For Windows, we deliver documentation not as a big bunch of HTML
      files, but as an HTML Help file (also called a CHM file).  HTML
      Help files provide full-text search capabilities, a full table
      of contents, and are much smaller than all the HTML sources.
      This section explains how to obtain this file.  Take yourself to
      a Unix machine. You will need <code/gawk/ and <code/nsgml/
      installed in your system. These tools are used to parse,
      validate, and normalize SGML and XML files. You can find them in
      <Ref.Extern to="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/gawk.html">
      <File>http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/gawk.html</File
      ></Ref.Extern> and <Ref.Extern to="http://www.jclark.com/sp/">
      <File>http://www.jclark.com/sp/</File ></Ref.Extern>. Then, do
      something like:

<<<unset OZHOME OZPATH OZEMULATOR TEXT2PICKLE
export PATH=/opt/gcc-2.95.3/bin:/opt/jdk/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/bin
mkdir /tmp/build
cd /tmp/build
?{mozart}/configure --prefix=?{linux-install} \
    --with-documents=all --enable-chm --with-stdlib=?{stdlib}
make bootstrap
make install>>>
      where ?{linux-install} is a directory different from the ?{install}
      directory.  Get back to your Windows machine and do:
<<<cd ?{linux-install}/doc
/cygdrive/c/Program\ Files/HTML\ Help\ Workshop/hhc Mozart>>>
      (assuming that you have ?{linux-install} on a network shared file
      system.  If not, you'll have to somehow copy this directory to
      your Windows machine).  <File/hhc/ is the HTML Help Compiler from
      Microsoft's HTML Help Workshop, available freely for download at
      <Ref.Extern to="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp"><File>http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp</File></Ref.Extern>.
      The current version is 1.4, but this one does not provide
      <File/hhc/. The version you'll have to install is 1.32.
      (If the URL is broken, search
      <Ref.Extern to="http://www.microsoft.com/"/Microsoft/'s site for
      <Q/download html help workshop/.  It seems Microsoft tends to
      reorganize their site every so often.)

    <P>
      This process will leave behind a file <File/Mozart.chm/, which we
      can copy to a sensible place:
      <<<cp Mozart.chm ?{install}/doc>>>
      If you want, you can delete from the ?{install}<File>/doc</File>
      directory all files except <File/Mozart.chm/ and the <File
      >demo/applets</File> directory.
  <Section id="section.cygwin.installer">
    <Title/Creating an Installer/
    <P>
      Windows applications are typically distributed as an installer,
      which not only creates the file system structure, but also adds
      the command line tools to the <Var type=env/PATH/, creates Start
      Menu entries, and establishes associations for file extensions
      (in our case, <File/.oz/ and <File/.ozg/ files are associated with
      <File/oz.exe/, and <File/.oza/ files are associated with <File
      /ozenginew.exe/).  Installers also provide a clean way of removing
      applications from your system.  The only reason I see why you would
      want to remove Mozart is to install a new release.
    <P>
      Creating an installer is not necessary if you do not plan to
      redistribute your Mozart build.  You can run Mozart from your
      ?{install} directory directly.
    <P>
      We build our installer with InnoSetup, which is a ?{free}
      installer for Windows programs. You can get it from <Ref.Extern
      to="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">
      <File>http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php</File

  - Old the stuff of the no longer supported InstallShield. (it was
    too expensive)

      We build our installer with InstallShield Developer which you can
      purchase (yes, these things cost real money!) on InstallShield's
      Web site at <Ref.Extern to="http://www.installshield.com/isd/"><File
      >http://www.installshield.com/isd/</File></Ref.Extern>.  Start
      up InstallShield Developer and open the project ?{mozart}<File
      >/misc/Mozart.ism</File>.  Under <Q/Advanced Views&emdash;Path
      Variables/ you have to adjust some variables:
      <Table>
        <TR><TH>Path Variable<TH>Purpose
        <TR><TD>SYSTEMROOT<TD>Directory where <File/hhc.exe/ resides,
          normally <File/C:\WINNT/.
        <TR><TD>Base<TD>Directory where you installed Mozart (called
          ?{install} above, but in Windows syntax here).
      </Table>
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Release Adjustments/
      When making a new release, you want the installer to document
      which Mozart version it installs.  Therefore, take care to set
      the following properties correctly.  Navigate to <Q/Organize Your
      Setup&emdash;General Information&emdash;Summary Information Stream/
      and update the <Q/Title/ field.  It is imperative that you generate
      a new GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) for the package that you're
      going to create:  Select the <Q/Package Code/ field and click on the
      <Q/Generate GUID/ button.  Next, find <Q/Product Properties/ (also
      under <Q/General Information/) and update the <Q/Product Version/
      field.
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Check Files/
      Before building, you should make sure that you didn't screw up and
      actually have all the files you need (and none you don't want).
      Run <<cd ?{install} && find . -type f | sort>> and <<diff>> the
      result with the file <Ref.Extern to="FILES"/<File/FILES//, which
      contains a list of all the files.
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Building/
      Now you're clear to build the release.  Start the
      <Q/Build&emdash;Release Wizard/ and select your options.  Choose
      a <Q/Product Configuration/ and a <Q/Release Name/ at random; it's
      fine to just accept the defaults.  Click <Q/Next/ until you can
      set the <Q/Media Type/ to <Q/Network Image/.  Next, select
      <Q/Compress all files/.  From Release 1.2.3, we deliver Mozart
      both as an <File/EXE/ and as an <File/MSI/, for the convenience of
      people who know that they already have Windows Installer on their
      machine&emdash;the only difference in the Release Wizard is whether
      you select <Q/Create installation launcher/ or not.  A couple of
      questions later, you can actually get the beast to work.
    <Para class=apropos><Title/The End/
      Congratulations!  You're the proud owner of a Mozart installer!
