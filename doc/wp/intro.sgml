<Chapter id="chapter.introduction">
  <Title/Introduction/

  <p>
    This document is an introduction to window programming in
    Mozart. Window programming means to build graphical and
    interactive interfaces for applications. 

  <p>
    In Mozart, the basic building blocks for window programming are
    <index/widget/widgets: objects that represent graphical entities like labels,
    buttons, and menus. <index/window/Windows are described compositionally by
    means of object hierarchies and are subject to dynamic and interactive
    modification. Other entities we will deal with are for example
    fonts and images. The appearance of widgets is managed by 
    geometry managers. Interaction events, such as pressing a mouse
    button, trigger execution of procedures or methods.

  <p>
    Mozart uses an object-oriented interface to Tk for window
    programming. The interface inherits from &Oz; concurrency, objects
    and first-class procedures. From Tk the interface inherits a set
    of powerful graphical abstractions. This document introduces both
    aspects: the basic usage of the graphical abstractions and how to
    profit from &Oz;'s language features. The interface employs a
    simple generic mapping to Tk.  People familiar with Tk will get
    acquainted very soon.

    <Title/The Examples/

    <p>
      The documents features a large number of <index/examples/examples which are
      designed to be tried by the reader. All examples are contained
      in a <ref.extern to="WindowProgramming.oz"/demo file/ to be used
      with the <ptr.extern to="ozdoc:opi">.

    <Title/Further Information/

    <p>
      One particular advantage of using Tk as graphics engine for
      Mozart is the wealth of excellent <index/documentation/documentation for Tcl and Tk.

    <p>
      A must read (or at least see or browse) in this particular
      respect is the original <Ref to="Ousterhout.94"/book/ of John
      Ousterhout. A very fascinating account on how to employ the
      graphical primitives in Tk for developing high-level graphical
      applications is <Ptr to="HarrisonMcLennan.98">.

    <p>
      The definitive entry point into the full collection of Tcl/Tk
      related resources and informations is the web page at
      <Ref.extern to="http://www.scriptics.com/"/Scriptics/, a company
      co-founded by John Ousterhout.

    <p>
      The details of all commands and widgets for Tcl and Tk can be
      found in the manpages that ship with the Tcl and Tk
      distributions. For convenience, the Mozart release includes HTML
      versions of <Ref.extern to="../tcltk/contents.htm"/them/, which
      carry the following <Ref.extern
      to="../tcltk/copyright.htm"/copyright/.

    <Title/Acknowledgements/

    <p>
      I am grateful to Michael Mehl, who co-authored an earlier
      version of this document. Peter Van Roy contributed the paragraph
      in <ptr to="section.widgets-2.return"> that explains why <<tkReturn>>
      is indeed asynchronous.
