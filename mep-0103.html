<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5" name="mozart-enhancement-proposals-meps">MOZART ENHANCEMENT PROPOSALS (MEPs)</a></h2>
<p>The development of Mozart will be handled by Mozart Enhancement
Proposals (MEPs).  All changes to Mozart will come through MEPs.
Anybody, whether user or developer, can introduce a MEP anytime.
There are two kinds of MEPs: &quot;informational&quot; and &quot;standard track&quot;.
Any significant change or contribution to the Mozart/Oz system or
governance procedure requires a standard track MEP.  No MEP is
required for routine modifications such as bug fixes that bring
the system closer to its specification.</p>
<p>For example, a MEP can be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>proposed changes in governance, process, website, etc.</li>
<li>proposal for a new release (this MEP can be very short,
e.g., mainly just proposing someone as release manager)</li>
<li>an extension of the language kernel (e.g., uniform state)</li>
<li>a new contribution to the standard library (e.g., QTk)</li>
<li>a bug fix that is not straightforward and benefits from a
discussion (e.g., garbage collection Y register bug fix)</li>
<li>a design with new concepts or ideas long before any actual
implementation exists (e.g., Oz-E for security)</li>
</ul>
<p>The last example is an &quot;informational&quot; MEP: it serves as a design
document for fleshing out possibilities and discovering whether this
is indeed a good idea that fits well with the Mozart/Oz philosophy
and could lead to acceptable extensions or contributions later.
Acceptance of such a MEP does not in itself signify a right or
expectation to change Mozart/Oz in any way.  Actual implementation
proposals are either extensions or contributions and require their
own separate standard track MEPs.</p>
<p>To introduce a MEP, the author writes a draft and posts it to
hackers at mozart-oz.org.  MEP editors register the MEP, assign it a
number, and publish it on the website.</p>
<p>Once a MEP has been registered, everybody in the community is welcome
and encouraged to debate the proposal and help shape it.  It is the
author's responsibility to lead and sustain these discussions, record
in the MEP the opinions expressed, document assenting and dissenting
points of view, amend and revise the proposal accordingly, and gather
community consensus behind it.  He should post revised versions of the
MEP to hackers at mozart-oz.org and ask the MEP editors to update the
copy published on the website.  When the author so chooses, he can ask
for a ruling from the Board.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="voting-procedure">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6" name="voting-procedure">VOTING PROCEDURE</a></h2>
<p>Only Board members can vote.  They vote publicly on the hackers list
with one of the following pronouncements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>ACCEPT : this MEP is good and ready</li>
<li>NOTACCEPT : this MEP is not ready or is incompatible with
Mozart/Oz philosophy</li>
<li>ABSTAIN : I do not wish to rule on this MEP</li>
</ul>
<p>Board members have exactly two weeks to vote.  After that delay their
vote is automatically ABSTAIN <a class="citation-reference" href="#note1" id="id2" name="id2">[NOTE1]</a> .  The decision of the Board is
computed from individual votes as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>ACCEPT &gt;= (2/3)*(ACCEPT+NOTACCEPT) and ACCEPT&gt;0
The proposal is accepted.  The Board then gives the author
the appropriate rights to do the development, if it is a
standard track MEP.  The author becomes responsible for
developing and maintaining this part of the system.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the proposal is not accepted.  The author is free to
continue work on the MEP or to make another MEP, according to
the advice given during the community discussion.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the spirit of Mozart/Oz, the community discussion is very important.
Therefore, it should rarely be the case that an author asks the Board
for a vote on a MEP that will probably not be accepted.  All the work
of design and compromises, of discussion, debate, refinements, and
revisions should preferably have been fully and satisfactorily
completed before the MEP's author asks the Board for an official
decision, i.e., a vote.  We recognize that there may be cases, i.e., a
stand-off between two opinions, when this is not possible.  The vote
can be used to break the stand-off in those cases.</p>
<p>There are many MEPs for which we can expect the period of community
debate to be rather short.  For example, when a package that has been
offered through MOGUL for a long while is then proposed for inclusion
in, e.g., the standard library, the MEP would say:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>this package is being proposed for inclusion in stdlib</li>
<li>this is its purpose</li>
<li>these are the reasons why it should be in stdlib</li>
<li>it should be inserted at this URI</li>
<li>here is the design/API</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this MEP is very simple and brief.  MEPs don't have to be
big.  Since the members of the Board are a subset of the community,
they too participate in the discussions.  In particular, they will
give their opinion on, e.g., whether this package belongs in stdlib,
should be offered as an official add-on, or should remain as an
individual contribution in MOGUL, or whether modifications of its API
would be desirable.  That should not take long.  Then it is a simple
matter to make it official with a vote of the Board.</p>
