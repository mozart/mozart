<Chapter id="chapter.text">
  <Title/Text Widgets/

  <p>
    <index/text/<index/widget<and>text/
    Text widgets display (as suggested by the name) one or more lines
    of text, where the text can be edited. It offers commands to
    manipulate segments of text and to embed other widgets into the
    flow of text. This chapter attempts to give a short overview on
    text widgets, for the details consult <ref.extern
    to="&tkcmd/text.htm"/<kbd/text//.

  <section id="section.text.widget">
    <title/Manipulating Text/

    <p>
      Let us start with a very simple example where we want to display
      a given text in a text widget. <ptr to="figure.text.started">
      shows a program that does the job.

    <p>
      <figure id="figure.text.started">
        <caption/Displaying text./
        <p>
               <picture.choice>
          <picture.extern to="display.gif" type=gif>
          <Picture.Extern id="pict.ext.text.display" to="pictures/text/display.eps" type=ps>
               </picture.choice>
<chunk class=anonymous><title/text display/
T={New Tk.text tkInit(parent:W width:28 height:5 bg:white)}
{T tk(insert 'end' "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.")}
</chunk>          
      </figure>

    <para class=apropos><title/scanning/
<index/scanning/
      Similar to <ref
      to="section.widgets-2.listbox"/listboxes/, a text widget
      supports scanning: The text can be scanned by pressing the
      second mouse button and moving the mouse pointer while the
      button is still being pressed. And of course, in the same way as
      canvas widgets scrollbars can be attached to a text widget. 

    <para class=apropos><title/text wrapping/
<index/text<and>wrapping/
      The text is wrapped where word boundaries (that is,
      spaces) are not taken into account. Changing the wrapping such
      that word boundaries are preserved can be done as follows:
<chunk class=anonymous><title/wrap:word/
{T tk(configure wrap:word)}
</chunk>

    <para id="para.text.position" class=apropos><title/positions/
<index class=tails/text<and>position/
      Positions in the displayed text can be referred to by
      <def/positions/. A position can be denoted by a tickle 
      <<p(?_{L} ?_{C})>>, where ?_{L} gives the line (starting from
      one) and ?_{C} the position in that line (also starting from
      zero). Positions also can take modifiers, for more details on
      this issue see <ref.extern
      to="&tkcmd/text.htm"/<kbd/text//. Another helpful position is
      <<'end'>> which refers to the position after the last character.

    <para class=apropos><title/getting text/
<index class=tails/text<and>getting/
      Portions of the text can be retrieved. For example,
<chunk class=anonymous><title/text get/
{T tkReturnAtom(get p(1 4) p(1 9) $)}
</chunk>
      returns the atom <<quick>>. 

    <para class=apropos><title/inserting text/
<index class=tails/text<and>inserting/
      Positions also specify where to insert text, for example
<chunk class=anonymous><title/text insert/
{T tk(insert p(1 4) "very very ")}
</chunk>
      inserts the text directly before quick.

    <para class=apropos><title/deleting text/
<index class=tails/text<and>deleting/
      In the same way text can also be deleted. For example
<chunk class=anonymous><title/text delete/
{T tk(delete p(1 4) p(1 14))}
</chunk>
      deletes again the text <<"very very ">>.

    <para class=apropos><title/disabling input/
<index class=tails/text<and>disabling input/
      We do not discuss here how to employ a text widget as a powerful
      editor, please see again <ref.extern 
      to="&tkcmd/text.htm"/<kbd/text//. If you try to place a cursor
      inside the text widget and make some character strokes, you will
      notice that by default a text widget accepts input. To prevent a
      user from altering the text in a display only situation the
      widget can be configured as follows:
<chunk class=anonymous><title/text disabled/
{T tk(configure state:disabled)}
</chunk>

   
  </section>

  <section id="section.text.tags">
    <title/Text Tags and Marks/

    <para class=apropos><title/creating tags/
<index class=tails/text<and>tag/
      In the same way as canvas widgets, text widgets support
      tags. While canvas tags refer to sets of items (see <ptr
      to="section.text.tags">),
      text tags refer to sets of characters and allow to configure
      and manipulate the set of characters. For example, the following
<index class=tails/<<Tk>><and><<textTag>>/
<chunk class=anonymous><title/text tag init/
B={New Tk.textTag tkInit(parent:T foreground:brown)}
</chunk>
      creates a new tag, where the tag is configured such that all
      characters that will be referred to by this tag (initially, no
      characters) are displayed in brown color.

    <para class=apropos><title/adding text/
      Already inserted text can be added to a tag by defining the text
      portion to be added with positions. The following
<chunk class=anonymous><title/text tag add/
{B tk(add p(1 10) p(1 15))}
</chunk>
      adds the text part <kbd/"brown"/ to the tag <<B>>, which changes
      the color of that text to brown.

    <para class=apropos><title/configuring tags/
      Changing the configuration of a tag takes effect on all
      characters that are referred to by that tag. For example, if the
      tag <<B>> is configured for a larger font as follows
<chunk class=anonymous><title/text tag configure/
{B tk(configure font:{New Tk.font tkInit(size:18)})}
</chunk>
      the text portion <kbd/"brown"/ now appears in that larger font.

    <para class=apropos><title/inserting and adding text/
      The <<insert>> command also supports tags directly. The following
<chunk class=anonymous><title/text tag insert/
{T tk(insert 'end' "\nDogs are ")}
{T tk(insert 'end' "brown" B)}
{T tk(insert 'end' " as well.")}
</chunk>
      adds three portions of text to the text widget, where the text
      <kbd/"brown"/ is both inserted and added to the tag <<B>>, which
      makes it appear both in brown color and with a large font. Now
      the text widget looks as shown in <ptr to="figure.text.tags">.

    <p>
      <figure id="figure.text.tags">
        <caption/Using tags with text widgets./
               <picture.choice>
        <picture.extern to="text-tags.gif" type=gif>
        <Picture.Extern id="pict.ext.text.text-tags" to="pictures/text/text-tags.eps" type=ps>
               </picture.choice>
      </figure>

    <p>
      In the same way as described in <ptr to="section.canvas.tags">
      for canvas tags, events can be attached to text tags. We will
      exemplify this in the <ref to="section.text.toy"/next section/.

    <p>
<index class=tails/text<and>mark/
<index class=tails/<<Tk>><and><<textMark>>/
      In addition to tags, text widgets also support
      <def/marks/. Marks refer to positions in the text rather than to
      particular characters as tags do. They are supported by the
      class <<Tk.textMark>>. For their use, see again <ref.extern
      to="&tkcmd/text.htm"/<kbd/text//.

  </section>


  <section id="section.text.toy">
    <title/Example: A ToyText Browser/

    <p>
      In the following we discuss a tiny ToyText browser that
      supports following of links in the text and going back to
      previously displayed pages. A ToyText hypertext is a
      record, where the features are the links and the fields describe
      pages. For an example, see <ptr
      to="data.text.toy">. A page consists out of head and body, where
      the body is a list of elements. An element is either a virtual
      string or a record <<a(ref:?_{R} ?_{Es})>>, where ?_{R} is a
      feature of the record and ?_{Es} is a list of elements.

    <p>
      <ptr to="figure.text.display"> shows the main routine to display
      a ToyText page in a text widget <<T>>. The procedure <<Display>>
      takes a list of references <<Rs>> as input, and displays the
      page that is referred to by its first element.

    <p>
      <figure id="figure.text.display">
        <caption/Displaying a ToyText page./
<chunk><title/Definition of Display/
proc {Display Rs}
   case Rs of nil then skip
   [] R|Rr then
     {T tk(delete p(0 0) 'end')}
     {Head ToyText.R.head Rr} {Body ToyText.R.body Rs}
   end      
end
</chunk>
      </figure>

    <p>
      <ptr to="figure.text.head"> shows how the head of a ToyText page
      is displayed, where <<E>> is the virtual string to be displayed
      and <<Rs>> is the list of current references without  its first
      element. The tag <<HT>> is configured such that clicking it
      displays the previous page.
      
    <p>

      <figure id="figure.text.head">
        <caption/Displaying the head of a ToyText page./
<chunk><title/Definition of Head/

   proc {Head E Rs}
      {T tk(insert p(0 0) E#'\n' HT)}
      {HT tkBind(event:  '<1>'
		 action: proc {$} {Display Rs} end)}
   end
end
</chunk>
      </figure>

    <p>
      <ptr to="figure.text.body"> shows how the body of a ToyText
      page is displayed, where <<Es>> is the list of elements, <<CT>> is
      the current tag to which inserted text is added, and <<Rs>> are
      the current references, including a reference to the page
      currently under display as first element. To display a reference
      element, a new tag <<RT>> is created that carries as action a
      procedure that displays the referred page.

    <p>
      <figure id="figure.text.body">
        <caption/Displaying the body of a ToyText page./
<chunk><title/Definition of Body/
local
   BF={New Tk.font    tkInit(family:helvetica size:12 weight:normal)}
   BT={New Tk.textTag tkInit(parent:T font:BF)}
   proc {Do Es CT Rs}
      case Es of nil then skip
      [] E|Er then
	 case E
	 of a(ref:R Es) then
	    RT={New Tk.textTag tkInit(parent:T font:BF
                                      foreground:blue underline:true)}
	 in
	    {RT tkBind(event: '<1>'
		       action: proc {$} {Display R|Rs} end)}
	    {Do Es RT Rs}
	 else
	    {T tk(insert 'end' E CT)}
	 end
	 {Do Er CT Rs}
