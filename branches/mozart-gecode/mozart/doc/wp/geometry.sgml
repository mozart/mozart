  <Title/Geometry Managers/

  <P>
    This chapter explains geometry managers.  Geometry managers compute how
    much space widgets occupy and at which position they appear on the screen.
    Last but not least they make widgets appear on the screen with the
    geometry computed previously.

  <Section id="section.geometry.intro">
    <Title/Widgets and Parcels/

    <P>
      A geometry manager computes the size and location of widgets, that is
      the geometry, and displays the widgets on the screen.  The geometry
      manager computes the geometry according to the widget hierarchy.
      During computation of the geometry, the manager takes the following
      three things into account:
      <List enum>
	<Item>
	  The geometry requested by slave widgets.  Widgets like labels and
	  messages request just enough space to displays their text or bitmap.
	<Item>
	  The geometry requested by master widgets.  Usually master widgets
	  do not request an explicit geometry.  But for example, if a frame
	  widget is initialized with explicit values for width and height, the
	  geometry manager takes these values into account.
	<Item>
	  The options given to the geometry manager.
      </List>

    <para class=apropos><title/parcels/
      The geometry manager computes for each slave of a master widget a
      so-called <Def/parcel/.  The parcel is a rectangle and describes the
      space and the position computed for the slave.  From the slaves'
      parcels the manager computes the parcel for the master.  If the master
      does not request a specific geometry on its own, the manager will
      assign the master a parcel that encloses all slave parcels.  Otherwise
      the geometry manager distributes the space in the parcel for the
      master to the slave parcels. This may shrink or grow the parcels for
      the slaves.

    <P>
      Options to the geometry manager affect usually the way how parcels are
      computed and how widgets are put into their parcels, if the parcels
      are larger (or smaller) than the parcel initially requested by the
      widget.

    <P>
      <index/packer/<index/pack/<index/grid/In the following we will show the two most important geometry managers
      which are provided in Tk.  One is the packer, which can be used for
      simple arrangements, like placing several widgets in a row or in a
      line.  The other geometry manager we will discuss is implemented by
      the <<grid>> command.  As the name suggests, the grid command allows
      for arranging widgets in a grid-like fashion. 

    <P>
      It is perfectly possible to mix geometry managers in a single toplevel
      widget provided that all slaves of a master are managed by the same
      manager.  For example, suppose a toplevel widget that contains two
      frames which contain widgets themselves.  Both frames must be managed
      by the same manager.  The widgets in the frames can be managed by two
      different managers.

    <P>
      We discuss only the most important options these two managers provide,
      a complete description can be found in <ref.extern
      to="&tkcmd/pack.htm"/<kbd/pack// and <ref.extern
      to="&tkcmd/grid.htm"/<kbd/grid//. More information on the packer
      can also be found in <ref to="Ousterhout.94"/John Ousterhout's
      book/ in Chapter&nbsp;17.

  <Section id="section.geometry.pack">
    <Title/The Packer/

    <P>
      The packer supports simple arrangements of widgets in rows and
      columns.  Arranging widgets nicely usually also means that some
      vertical and horizontal space has to be inserted, either designed to
      provide for additional space or to fill up space not occupied by the
      widget's original size.

    <P>
      The different ways how to affect the geometry we will study by means
      of examples.  For this, let us assume we are dealing with three label
      widgets.  The following function creates a toplevel widget with
      background color white for better visibility, and returns a list of
      three labels.
<chunk class=anonymous><title/NewLabels/
fun {NewLabels}
   W={New Tk.toplevel tkInit(background:white)}
in
   {Map ['label' 'Second label widget' '3rd label']
    fun {$ A}
       {New Tk.label tkInit(parent:W text:A)}
    end}
end
</chunk>

    <P>
      To display the labels in the toplevel widget, the packer can be
      invoked as follows:
<index/<<pack>>/
<chunk class=anonymous><title/pack basic/
[L1 L2 L3] = {NewLabels}
{Tk.send pack(L1 L2 L3)}
</chunk>

    <P id="para.geometry.batch">
      This computes and displays a geometry for the toplevel widget as shown
      in <Ptr to="figure.geometry.pack-basic">.  Rather than giving a tickle
      which contains each of the labels as field we can give a <Def/batch
      tickle/.  A batch tickle is a tuple with label&nbsp;<<b>> where its
      single argument must be a list of tickles.  By using a batch tickle,
      we can rewrite our example from above to
<chunk class=anonymous><title/pack batch/
{Tk.send pack(b({NewLabels}))}
</chunk>
      where the list of tickles is the list of labels as returned by the
      function <<NewLabels>>.

	For pleasant overall geometry it is imported that widgets have similar
	geometries.  The packer employs two different schemes how widgets can
	be arranged to have similar geometries.  One is filling: the widget
	extends over its entire parcel.  The other one is expansion: the
	widget's parcel is extended such that the parcels of all slaves in
	a master occupy the master's parcel entirely.

	Expansion is only significant when the parcels of the slave do not

	the parcel of the master was computed by the packer to be just large
	enough to contain the slave's parcels.  So there was no additional
	space in the master's parcel to be filled by expansion of slave
	parcels.
