  <title/Linux RPM Packages/

  <p>
    There is very little to say about installing Mozart by means of an
    RPM package apart from the fact that it works as usual. This
    chapter is mainly intended for persons that never used rpm before,
    but run a rpm based Linux installation (like <ref.extern
    to="http://www.redhat.com/"/RedHat/).

    <p>
      Mozart is split up in three binary rpm packages:

      <table id="table.rpm.bin">
        <tr/<th/Package Name/ <th/Content//
        <tr/<td/<file/mozart// <td/The base system. Contains all you need to
        run demos and develop Oz programs with Mozart.//
        <tr/<td/<file/mozart-doc// <td/The Mozart documentation. Although the package
        takes up a lot of disk space, you are very much encouraged to
        install it.//
        <tr/<td/<file/mozart-contrib// <td/Mozart Contributions. Software
        packages that are not in the core of the system, but might
        come in handy for applications: regular expression matching,
        data base interfaces, and so on.//
      </table>

    <p>
      You first have to download the packages you want from
      <ref.extern
      to="http://www.mozart-oz.org/download/view.cgi?action=rpm"><file>http://www.mozart-oz.org/download/view.cgi?action=rpm</file></ref.extern>. 

    <p>
      In order to install a rpm package you have to become
      <samp/root/:
      <<<su ->>>
      Then install the <file/mozart/ package first (it will have a 
      filename similar to <file/mozart-1.0.0.012199-21.i386.rpm/):
      <<<rpm -Uvh mozart-1.0.0.012199-21.i386.rpm>>>
      Similarly, you can install the <file/mozart-doc/ and
      <file/mozart-contrib/ packages.

    <p>
      These packages depend only on other packages that are
      shipped with the 5.2 (Apollo) release of
      RedHat, however it also should work with the 5.0 (Hurricane) and
      5.1 (Manhattan) releases. In case you come across an error
      message like the following 
      <code display proglang=none>
failed dependencies:
        libgmp.so.2 is needed by mozart-1.0.0.012199-21
      </code>
      you have to install the <file>gmp</file> rpm package. It
      ships with RedHat 5.2 but not with earlier releases. It is
      available from:
<p>
<ref.extern to="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/redhat-5.2/i386/RedHat/RPMS/gmp-2.0.2-5.i386.rpm"><file>ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/redhat-5.2/i386/RedHat/RPMS/gmp-2.0.2-5.i386.rpm</file></ref.extern>
<p>
      or from one of the RedHat mirrors.
   
    <p>
      If you now open a new shell on your computer, all Mozart related
      commands are automatically available. Just try
      <<<oz>>>
      to start the Oz Programming Environment. Note that the commands
      are available only after you started a new shell (or logged in
      again). 

    <p>
      The toplevel html page for the documentation resides at the
      following url:
      <file display>file:///usr/lib/mozart/doc/index.html</file>
     
    <p> 
      The webpage for downloading also gives additional information on
      which system the rpm packages were build.

    <p>
      After installation you should make your web browser Mozart
      application enabled, which is described in <ptr to="appendix.applets">.
