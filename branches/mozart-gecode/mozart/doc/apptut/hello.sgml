<Chapter id="Chapter.Hello">
  <Title/Getting Started/

  <p>      
    The purpose of programming languages is of course the construction
    of applications. In this chapter we will use Oz for our first
    small application.

  <section id="section.hello.webget" proglang=sh>
    <title/Our First Application: <file/Webget.oza//

    <p>
      Our first application is a program that copies a file from a
      url to a local file. The program is called <file/Webget.oza/. 

<figure id="figure.hello.invoke">
  <caption/Get yourself a Mozart license./
<<<ozengine Webget.oza --in http://www.mozart-oz.org/LICENSE --out LICENSE>>>
</figure>

    <p>
      Our goal is to have an application that can be started like any
      other application from the
      operating system shell. For example, executing the command shown in 
      <ptr to="figure.hello.invoke"> 
      gets us a local copy of the Mozart license file.

    <p>
      In addition to taking arguments from the command line,
      <file/Webget.oza/ should
      report problems by returning an error status to the operating
      system shell. The error status is an integer, where the value
      <<0>> means okay. Any other values signals an error.

  <section id="section.hello.structure">
    <title/What to do?/

    <p>
      In the following we consider the three main steps in
      constructing our application. We give a brief outline of what to
      do, the following sections are going to detail the steps.

    <p>
    <list>
      <entry>Definition
      <item>
        The first step, of course, is to program our
        application. For this purpose, we will create a file
        <file/Webget.oz/ that contains the Oz program implementing
        <kbd/webget/. More specifically, the file <file/Webget.oz/
        contains a <def/functor definition/.

      <entry>Compilation
      <item>
        Next, we compile the functor definition contained in
        <file/Webget.oz/. The compiler takes the functor definition
        and executes it. By this it creates a <def/functor/. Then the
        functor is written to a file <file/Webget.oza/. This persistent
        representation of a functor value is called a <def/pickled functor/.

      <entry>Execution 
      <item>
        The pickled functor <file/Webget.oza/ is executed by the Oz
        virtual machine <file/ozengine/. The engine takes a pickled
        functor (<file/Webget.oza/ in our case), unpickles the
        functor, runs the functor, and supplies it with application
        arguments. After execution terminates, it reports the
        application's execution status back to the operating system
        shell.
    </list>

  <section id="section.hello.definition">
    <title/Functor Definition: <file/Webget.oza//

    <p>
      The toplevel structure of the file <file/Webget.oz/ is as
      follows.

<p>
<chunk><title/Webget.oz/
functor
   <chunk.ref/Module import/
   <chunk.ref/Functor body/
end
</chunk>

    <para class=apropos><title/Importing modules/
      Our application requires the system module <<Application>> to
      both process the command line arguments as well as for
      terminating the application. In addition, the module <<Open>>
      provides the class <<Open.file>> required for reading and
      writing files.

    <p>
      The functor needs to <def/import/ these two modules. The
      functor definition thus contains the following import
      specification: 
<p>
<chunk><title/Module import/
import 
   Application 
   Open
</chunk>

    <p>
      The import specification serves two purposes: the
      variable identifiers <<Application>> and <<Open>> are introduced
      with a lexical scope that extends over the entire
      body of the functor. Secondly, the identifiers also serve
      as <def/module names/. When the functor corresponding to this
      definition is executed, the variables are given as values the
      system modules with the same names.

    <p>
      More precisely, the import specification above is a convenient
      abbreviation for the more verbose specification below:
<chunk><title/Module import (no convenience)/
import 
   Application at 'x-oz://system/Application'
   Open        at 'x-oz://system/Open'
</chunk>
      In <ptr to="section.modman.import"> we will discuss system
      modules in more detail. In particular, <ptr
      to="table.modman.system"> lists available system modules.

    <para class=apropos><title/Functor body/
      The <def/body of a functor/ is a statement that is executed
      when the application is run. 
<p>
<chunk><title/Functor body/
define
   <chunk.ref/Argument processing/
   Status = try
               <chunk.ref/Opening input and output files/
            in
               <chunk.ref/Copying input file to output file/
               0
            catch _ then 1
            end
   <chunk.ref/Terminating the application/
</chunk>
     
    <p> 
      The structure for our application is straightforward: after
      processing the command line arguments, file objects for source and 
      destination are created and the content is copied from the
      source file to the
      destination file. 

    <p>
      If a runtime error occurs either during opening the files or
      while copying the file content, the raised exception is caught
      and the <<Status>> is bound to <<1>>.
      Otherwise, <<Status>> gets bound to zero.

    <p> 
      Note that the body of a functor is like the part of a 
      <<local ... in ... end>> statement before the <<in>>: definitions
      and statements are allowed, where the left hand side of
      definitions can introduce variables.

    <para class=apropos><title/Processing arguments/
      The application needs two input parameters: the URL to get the
      file from, and the file name under which the downloaded content
      should be stored.

    <p>
      The following application of <<Application.getCmdArgs>>
<p>
<chunk><title/Argument processing/
Args = {Application.getArgs record('in'(single type:string)
                                   'out'(single type:string))}
</chunk>
      computes <<Args>> to be a record (as signalled by the label
      <<record>> of the single argument to
      <ref.extern key="section.application.module" to="ozdoc:system"
      /<<Application.getArgs>>/. The features of the record are
      <<'in'>> and <<'out'>> where both fields are of type string
      and both are allowed to be given only once on the command line
      (that is specified by <<single>>).

    <p>
      For a complete reference of how application arguments are
      processed see <ptr.extern to="ozdoc:system"
      key="chapter.application">.

    <para class=apropos><title/Opening input &amp; output/
      The two files are opened as follows:
<p>
<chunk><title/Opening input and output files/
I={New Open.file init(url:  Args.'in')}
O={New Open.file init(name: Args.'out' 
                      flags:[write create truncate])}
</chunk>
      Note how the strings <code/Args.'in'/ and <code/Args.'out'/
      computed by argument processing are
      used for the source URL and the destination filename.

    <para class=apropos><title/Copying input to output/
      Copying the file from source to destination is straightforward:
      As long as we can read a non-empty string <<S>> from the source file,
      we write it to the destination file and repeat the procedure.
<p>
<chunk><title/Copying input file to output file/
local
   proc {Copy}
      S={I read(list:$)}
   in
      if S\="" then 
         {O write(vs:S)} {Copy} 
      end
   end
in 
   {Copy}
end
</chunk>

    <para class=apropos><title/Terminating the application/
      Termination of the application is effected by invocation of
      <<Application.exit>> which takes the application status as
      single integer argument. In our case an exit value of <<1>>
      indicates an error, otherwise <<0>> is returned to the operating
      system shell.
<p>
<chunk><title/Terminating the application/
{Application.exit Status}

  <section id="section.hello.compile" proglang=sh>
    <title/Compilation/

    <p>
      As is the case for many programming languages, the functor
      definition must be compiled before it can be executed.  This is
      achieved by invoking the Oz compiler <<ozc>> as follows:
<<<ozc -c Webget.oz -o Webget.oza>>>

    <p>
      Note the intentional similarity between the options
      illustrated above and those accepted by a C compiler.
      The compiler <<ozc>> offers a variety of other options that
      control compilation, an overview of which can be found in
      <ptr.extern to="ozdoc:tools" key="chapter.compiler">.

  <section id="section.hello.exec" proglang=sh>
    <title/Execution/

    <p>
      The functor pickled into <file/Webget.oza/ can be executed by
      applying the program <file/ozengine/ to the functor and the
      application arguments. For example, to copy the Mozart license
      file at url
      <file>http://www.mozart-oz.org/LICENSE</file> to the local
      file <file/LICENSE/, simply enter the command line shown in <ptr to="figure.hello.invoke"> at your
      shell promt.

    <p>
      Execution of an application proceeds as follows:
      <list enum>
        <item> <<ozengine>>, the Oz virtual machine, is started by the
        operating system.
        <item> <<ozengine>> starts to execute a <def/module manager/.
        <item> The module manager loads the pickled functor
        <file/Webget.oza/. This initial application functor is called
        the <def/root functor/.
        <item> The module manager <def/links/ the functor by applying
        the functor body to <def/argument modules/. The argument
        modules in our example are  
        the system modules <code proglang=oz/Application/ and
        <code proglang=oz/Open/. 
        <item> Then it executes the functor body.
      </list> 

    <p>
      The different steps in application are detailed in the
      following sections.
