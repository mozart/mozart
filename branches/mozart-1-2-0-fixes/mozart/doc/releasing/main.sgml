    <title/Making Releases/

    <Abstract>
    This document explains how to create releases for various platforms.
    </Abstract>

    <chapter id="chap.intro">
      <title/Introduction/
      <p>You need to get, from the Mozart CVS archive, the sources
      corresponding to the release.  A release is identified by a tag,
      e.g. <code/mozart-1-2-2-a/.  In the following, I'll write
      <code/$REL/ for the release tag.  Use <code/ssh/, &ie; set
      environment variable <code/CVS_RSH=ssh/.
      <code display>cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.mozart-oz.org:/services/mozart/CVS get -r $REL mozart</code>
      Get yourself a cup of coffee, and by the time you've savoured it
      you have become the proud owner of a copy of the Mozart
      sources.  I will refer to the top directory containing these
      sources as <code/$SOURCE/: it is typically called <file/mozart/
      unless you used option <code/-d/ to the CVS <code/get/ command
      (which is unrelated to the <code/-d/ option to the <code/cvs/
      command itself).</p>
      <p>In order to build the release, you should create a separate
      build directory.  I will call it <code/$BUILD/.  <code/$BUILD/
      should not be created in <code/$SOURCE/ tree.  Simplest is to
      create it as a sibling of <code/$SOURCE/.</p>
      <p>To build the system, you first need to configure it.  Make
      very sure that no OZ utilities are found in your shell's search
      path and no OZ related variables are set in your environment.
      Personally, I have defined shell aliases <code/ozon/ and
      <code/ozoff/ to switch between having OZ utilities in my path
      and having a pristine environment blissfully unaware of things
      Mozartian.
      <code display>cd $BUILD
$MOZART/configure</code>
      By default, this will set things up to install in the default
      location <file>/usr/local/oz</file>.  You can change this
      default using option <code/--prefix=DIR/.  It's a good idea to
      set up dependencies in case you need to update the sources and
      then rebuild what needs rebuilding:
      <code display>make depend</code>
      Now, you can build the system:
      <code display/make/
      And optionally install it:
      <code display/make install/
      or install it in a different installation directory <code/$DIR/:
      <code display/make install PREFIX=$DIR/
      Note that it is not possible to skip the <code/make/ step and
      directly invoke <code/make install/.  At the top level
      <code/make/ is equivalent to <code/make bootstrap/. If you want
      to do it in one command, then you need to type:
      <code display/make bootstrap install/</p>
      <p>If you need to reconfigure, beware that <code/configure/
      builds a cache of configuration data in
      <file>$BUILD/config.cache</file>.  You may need to remove
      that.</p>
      <p>In order to also build the documentation, you need to invoke
      configure with option:
      <code display>--with-documentation=all</code></p>
    </chapter>

    <chapter id="chap.tarballs">
      <title/Tarballs/
      <section>
        <title/Source Tarball/
	<p>This assumes that you have checked out the sources and
	configured a build directory (see <ptr to="chap.intro">).
	The top level <file/Makefile/ provides support for creating a
	source tarball:
	<code display>cd $BUILD
make src</code>
        This will result in the creation of file
	<file>mozart-$VERSION.$DATE-src.tar.gz</file>
	where <code/$VERSION/ is the release number and <code/$DATE/
	is the build date (the current date).  That's it, you're
	done.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title/Documentation Tarball/
	<p>For this, you need to build and install the documentation.
	As mentioned earlier, this requires that you configured using
	option <code/--with-documents=all/.  Note that building the
	documentation takes very long and you need additional software
	on your machine (such as LaTeX, nsgmls, Ghostscript, the
	netpbm package, also java if you are going to build the
	postscript and pdf documentation, and probably other things I
	forget).</p>
	<p>Let's assume that you
	configured, built and installed the system (I will not explain
	here how to additionally create the Postscript and PDF
	documentation).  The top level <file/Makefile/ contains
	support for creating a documentation tarball:
	<code display>cd $BUILD
make doc</code>
        This will suck in all the installed documentation and create
	file <file>mozart-$VERSION.$DATE-src.tar.gz</file>.</p>
	<p>Except I lied and you need to install the standard library
	before that, else its doc will be missing.  See below.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title/Binary Tarballs/
	<p>Here again, we assume that you have configured, built and
	installed the system.  The top level <file/Makefile/ contains
	support for creating binary tarballs:
	<code display>cd $BUILD
make bin</code>
	This will suck in from the installation directory all
	necessary files to include in the binary tarballs.  As a
	result, three tarballs are created:
<list>
<item><file>mozart-$VERSION.$DATE-$PLATFORM.tar.gz</file></item>
<item><file>mozart-$VERSION.$DATE-$PLATFORM-contrib.tar.gz</file></item>
<item><file>mozart-$VERSION.$DATE-$PLATFORM-internal.tar.gz</file></item>
</list>
        where <code/$PLATFORM/ stands for your platform, &ie; the
	value returned by shell script:
	<code display>$SOURCE/share/bin/ozplatform</code>
        You can ignore the last tarball.</p>
	<subsection>
	  <title/Mozart Standard Library/
	  <p>In order to produce a complete binary distribution, you
	  also need to install the Mozart Standard Library.  You must
	  do this before invoking <code/make bin/.  It can be obtained
	  from the CVS server as follows:
	  <code display>cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.mozart-oz.org:/services/mozart/CVS get -r $REL mozart-stdlib</code>
	  you can create a tarball for the standard library by
	  invoking
	  <code display>make STDLIB=... std</code>
	  where <code/.../ is the directory where you checked out the
	  standard library.
	  However, before you do this, you need to have
	  <code/ozengine/ and <code/ozmake/ in your path.  As a
	  result, the following tarball is created:
	  <list>
	    <item><file>mozart-$VERSION.$DATE-$PLATFORM-std.tar.gz</file></item>
	  </list>
	</subsection>
	<subsection>
	  <title/Non-Linux Platforms/
	  <p>Mozart requires a number of libraries which are not
	  necessarily available by default on Non-Linux platforms.
	  You will need to provide these libraries with the binary
	  release.  There are 2 ways: using static linking or using
	  shared object libraries.  I will describe the second way.
	  Note, that the situation may be further complicated by the
	  question of whether your platform supports dynamic linking
	  or not.
	  </p>
	  <subsubsection>
	    <title/Using Shared Object Libraries/
	    <p>The aim here is to provide both the compiled system
	    together with the dynamic libraries that it requires.
	    Here is a little known fact: the scripts that invoke OZ
	    utilities are designed to modify the search path for
	    dynamic libraries so that the linker also looks first in:
	    <code display>$HOME/.oz/platform/$PLATFORM/lib</code>
	    and then in
	    <code display>$PREFIX/platform/$PLATFORM/lib</code>
	    where <code/$PREFIX/ stands for the installation
	    directory.  Thus, the trick is to plunk the necessary
	    shared libraries into this last directory before building the
	    binary tarballs.</p>
	    <p>Of course, the assumption is that you will be able to
	    fetch the missing packages and build or otherwise obtain
	    shared object libraries for them.  This is usually the
	    case.</p>
	  </subsubsection>
	  <subsubsection>
	    <title>Tcl/Tk</title>
	    <p>This is frequently a pain in the rear.  Check other
	    documentation as well as
	    <file>$SOURCE/platform/wish/configure.in</file>.</p>
	  </subsubsection>

    <chapter>
      <title/RPMs/
      <section>
        <title/Binary RPMs/
        <p>If your platform uses RPMs, then you are in luck.  Download
        the source RPM from our download page, become somebody really
	important (I mean <code/root/) and execute:
	<code display>rpm --rebuild mozart-$VERSION.$DATE-src.rpm</code>
	This will create the binary RPMs in
	<file>/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386</file>.
      </section>
      <section>
        <title/Source RPM/
	<p>In order to create the source RPM, you need to have already
	created or downloaded the source, documentation, and standard
	library tarballs.
	Become somebody important and execute:
	<code display>$SOURCE/misc/create-rpm $BUILD $BUILD</code>
	Note that this will create both a source RPM and binary RPMs.
	They will be placed in <code>$BUILD</code> or whatever
	directory you supplied as the second argument to
	<file/create-rpm/:
<list>
<item><file>mozart-$VERSION-$DATE-$REVISION.src.rpm</file></item>
<item><file>mozart-$VERSION-$DATE-$REVISION.i386.rpm</file></item>
<item><file>mozart-contrib-$VERSION-$DATE-$REVISION.i386.rpm</file></item>
<item><file>mozart-doc-$VERSION-$DATE-$REVISION.i386.rpm</file></item>
</list>

      </section>

    <chapter proglang=sh>
      <title/Check-List For Release Managers/
      <p>This chapter is intended for release managers of the Mozart
      consortium.  Below is the very abbreviated list of steps to
      follow for creating a new release:
      <list>
        <item>bump up the version in file
	<file>OZVERSION</file></item>
	<item>update version specific changes in
	<file>doc/changes/main.sgml</file></item>
	<item>cut a new tag in the CVS.  For example, if you wish
	to cut a tag for version 1.2.3 on the current release branch.
	You should check it out, cd to the directory of the checked
	out version and issue the following command:
	<code display/cvs tag -r mozart-1-2-3/</item>
	<item>then you should configure, build and install the
	release.  In particular, you should configure with option
	<code/--with-documents=all/.</item>
	<item>As stated above, you should then <code/make/ followed by
	<code/make install/.</item>
	<item>Now you need to make the postscript and pdf
	documentation.  cd to the build doc directory and invoke
	<code/make ps/ followed by <code/make pdf/.  Finally do
	<code/make installps/.</item>
	<item>cd back to the top build directory and now invoke
	<code/make src doc bin/ in order to create all the necessary
	tar files.  Note that you also need to create a <file/README/
	file which describes the important points about linking:  This
	can be done by using <code>ldd</code> on
	<file>platform/emulator/emulator.exe</file> and on
	<file>platform/wish/tk.exe</file>.  Note that depending on
	whether you used <code>--enable-static-linking</code> or not,
	you should rename the tar and README files accordingly so that
	they can be distinguished.  My own preference is to add
	<code/-dynfull/ when dynamic linking is used and
	<code/-dynless/ when <code/--enable-static-linking/ (and
	possibly <code/--enable-modules-static/ - I normally specify
	both of them when I am interested in a more statically linked
	distribution) was used instead.
	For example, here are the names of the tar and README files
	for release 1.2.3 for the dynamically linked version of the
	mozart release for freebsd on the intel architecture:
	<list>
	  <item><file>README.freebsdelf-i486-dynfull</file></item>
	  <item><file>mozart-1.2.3.20011121-freebsdelf-i486-dynfull-contrib.tar.gz</file></item>
	  <item><file>mozart-1.2.3.20011121-freebsdelf-i486-dynfull.tar.gz</file></item>
	</list>
	</item>
	<item>now become root and invoke
	<code>$SOURCE/misc/create-rpm $PWD $PWD</code>.  This creates
	the source and binary rpms.</item>
	<item>Now you need to create and populate the ftp directory
	for the release.  For this, you need to be logged into the
	consortium's ftp machine.  Currently this is <code/grizzly/ in
	Saarbrücken.  Become <code/root/:
	  <list>
	    <entry><code>perl $SOURCE/misc/mkftp --release=$VERSION --create</code></entry>
	    <item>this creates the directory structure for the
	    release.  Use option <code/-n/ to see what <code/mkftp/
	    would do without actually doing it.</item>
	    <entry><code>perl $SOURCE/misc/mkftp --release=$VERSION --tar *.tar.gz README.*</code></entry>
	    <item>this will install the tar and README files appropriately.</item>
	    <entry><code>perl $SOURCE/misc/mkftp --release=$VERSION --rpm=redhat *.rpm</code></entry>
	    <item>install the source and binary RPMs.</item>
	  </list>
	</item>
      </list>
    </chapter>
