<Chapter id="chapter.widgets-1">
  <Title/Widgets/

  <P>
    This chapter introduces some of the widget objects provided by the Tk
    interface.  Examples illustrate the most common options and
    the values they can take.

  <Section id="section.widgets-1.toplevel">
    <Title/Toplevel Widgets and Widget Objects/

    <P>
      A <span class=index/toplevel widget/ serves as the outermost <def/container/ for
      other widgets. 
      It can be created from the class <index class=tails/<<Tk>><and><<toplevel>>/<<Tk.toplevel>> and can be initialized
      by applying it to a message with label <span class=index/<<tkInit>>/.  An example is shown
      in <Ptr to="picture.widgets-1.toplevel">.  The features <span class=index/<<width>>/ and
      <span class=index/<<height>>/ of the message together with their values specify that the
      toplevel widget is 150 pixels wide and 50 pixels high.

    <p>
      <Figure id="picture.widgets-1.toplevel">

    <P>
      Creating and initializing a widget object creates a graphical image
      for the widget object.  We will refer to the graphical image just as
      the widget.  Most often we will not distinguish between the object and
      its widget.  A toplevel widget is special in that its graphical image
      appears immediately on the screen after the widget object has been
      initialized.  Other widgets require to be managed by a so-called
      geometry manager before they appear on the screen.  See <Ptr
      to="chapter.geometry"> for a discussion of geometry managers.

    <P>
      A widget object can be sent a message with
      label <span class=index/<<tk>>/ to change
      the appearance or behavior of its
      widget. For example, the <span
      class=index/background 
      color/ of the toplevel widget <<W>> can be
      changed to purple by
<chunk class=anonymous><title/{Tk.toplevel tk(configure)}/ 
{W tk(configure background:purple)}
</chunk>
      Additionally, a widget object understands messages that
      query its state.  These will be discussed later.

    <P>
      <index/widget<and>close/A widget object can
      be closed by applying 
      the object to the message 
      <span class=index/<<tkClose>>/.  Closing the
      widget object also destroys the widget 
      displayed on the screen.  <Ptr to="section.widgets-1.hierarchy">
      contains more details concerning how widget objects are closed.

    <P>
      The structure of messages with labels <span
      class=index/<<tkInit>>/ and <span
      class=index/<<tk>>/ depend on the particular
      widget under consideration.  However, all of
      these messages share a common structure.
      The following section explains this
      structure and shows how to build messages
      such that they are understood by widgets.

    <p>
      <index/widget<and>toplevel/Reference
      information on toplevel widgets can be found
      in  
      <ref.extern to="&tkcmd;/toplevel.htm"/<kbd/toplevel//. 

  <Section id="section.widgets-1.tickles">
    <Title/The Graphics Engine, Tickles, and Widget Messages/

    <P>
      Widget objects as well as instances of other
      classes defined in the 
      <span class=index/<<Tk>> module/ are built
      as object oriented frontends to a single 
      graphical agent, the <Def/graphics engine/.

    <SubSection>
      <Title/The Graphics Engine/

      <P>
	The graphics engine receives messages and executes them.  By
	executing a message the engine creates widgets, configures the
	appearance and behavior of widgets, or computes a geometry for
	the layout of a widget on the screen.

      <para class=apropos><title/tickles/ The
	messages the engine understands are
	<Def/tickles/. The procedures <index
	class=tails/<<Tk>><and><<send>>/<<Tk.send>>
	and <index
	class=tails/<<Tk>><and><<batch>>/<<Tk.batch>>
	take a tickle or a list of tickles and
	send it to the graphics engine.  We use
	these two procedures especially to send
	tickles for geometry management, as is
	discussed in <Ptr to="chapter.geometry">.

      <para class=apropos><title/translating
	object messages to tickles/ Messages sent
	to widgets and other objects of the Tk
	interface are translated in a
	straightforward fashion to tickles.  These
	tickles are then forwarded to the graphics
	engine.

    <SubSection>
      <Title/Tickles and Widget Messages/

      <P>
	Tickles are used to describe messages for
	the graphics engine.  A <def/tickle/ is either a
	boolean value, the name <<unit>>, a
	virtual string, a record that has neither
	a name as label nor as feature, or a
	tickle object.  A <def/tickle object/ is
	any instance of a class that the Tk module
	provides, unless otherwise mentioned (the
	only exception is the class
	<<Tk.listener>>, see <ptr
	to="section.widgets-2.action">).

      <P>
	An initialization message with label
	<<tkInit>> must be a record without
	integer features.  The field of a feature
	must be a tickle.  Only the special
	features <<parent>>, <<action>>, <<url>>,
	and <<args>> may take different values.
	These features we will discuss later.

      <para class=apropos><title/options/ To the
	features we refer to as <Def/configuration
	options/, or for short as <Def/options/.
	Their values we refer to as <Def/option
	values/.

      <para class=apropos><title/commands and
	arguments/ A message with label <<tk>>
	must be a record with at least a single
	integer feature and maybe some other
	integer features and some options.  The
	value of the first integer feature we call
	the <Def/command/, whereas we refer to the
	remaining values for the integer features
	as <Def/arguments/.  For example, in the
	message 
        <<<tk(set active background:purple)>>> 
        <<set>> is the
	command, <<active>> is the single
	argument, and <<background>> is an option
	with value <<purple>>.

    <SubSection>
      <Title/Translating Tickles/

      <p>
        <index/tickle<and>translation to strings/
        The graphics engine does not understand
        tickles but strings that follow a
        particular structure. This means that each
        tickle sent to the graphics engine is
        first translated to a string. The
        translation is generic, for our purposes
        here it suffices to give a short
        example. The full translation details can
        be found in <Ptr.extern to="ozdoc:system"
        key="chapter.tk">.

      <P>
	For example,
	<<<example("test" 1 2.0 side:left(right:true) fill:x)>>>
	is translated to
	<<<"example test 1 2.0 -side left -right 1 -fill x">>> That
	is, a record is translated to a string consisting of the label
	and the features and the translation of the fields.
	Atomic features are prepended by a <<"-">> and integer
	features are ignored.


    <SubSection>
      <Title>Special Tickles</Title>

      <p> <index/tickle<and>special/Additionally,
        special tickles are supported (see <Ptr

  <Section id="section.widgets-1.frame">
    <Title/Frames/

    <P>
      <index/widget<and>frame/Frame widgets are similar to toplevel widgets in that they serve
      as containers for other widgets.  The difference is that a frame
      is used as container within other widgets, whereas a toplevel
      widget is the outermost container.  The main purpose of frames
      is to determine geometrical layouts for the widgets they
      contain.  More on geometry management we see in <Ptr
      to="chapter.geometry">. 

    <SubSection id="section.widgets-1.relief">
      <Title/Relief Options/

      <para class=apropos><title/relief and border/
	Frames support the <index
	class=tails/option<and><<relief>>/<<relief>>
	and <index class=tails/option<and><<borderwidth>>/<<borderwidth>> options.  These
	options determine a three dimensional border to be drawn around
	a frame.  The values for the <<relief>> option must be one of
	<index

        <index

      <P>
	The program shown in <Ptr to="figure.widgets-1.relief-frames"> maps the
	list of relief option values to frame objects.  To make the frame with
	the option <<flat>> visible, its background is configured to be black.

      <P>
	Note that we left out the code to create the toplevel widget.  Here
	and in the following we assume that the variable&nbsp;<<W>> is bound
	to a toplevel widget.  The <ref.extern
	to="WindowProgramming.oz"/example file/, however, contains the
	code needed to create the toplevel widget.

      <P>

      <Title/Screen Distance Options/

      <P>
	<index/option<and>screen distance/As value for the <<borderwidth>> option we used an integer in the

	giving a number specifies a distance in <Def/screen pixels/.  If

	millimeters, inches (2.54 centimeters), or printers' points
	(<math.choice><math html>1/72</math><math latex>1/72</math>
	</math.choice> inch).

      <P>
	A convenient way to specify screen distances that employ units is
	to use a virtual string that appends the unit letter to the number,
	as used in <Ptr to="figure.widgets-1.relief-frames">.

      <Title/Color Options/

      <P>
	<index/option<and>color/To make the frame with the <<relief>> option <<flat>> visible, we

	<index/option<and>color<and>symbolic/A symbolic color value can be given as virtual string like <<black>>,

      <para class=apropos><title/numerical color values/
	<index/option<and>color<and>numerical/A numerical color value is determined by three integers between <<0>>
	and <<255>>.  The three integers describe the red, green, and blue part
	of the color.  A numerical color value in &Oz; can be specified by a
	ternary tuple with label&nbsp;<<c>>, where the three fields of the
	tuple are the three integers.  For example, the base colors red, green,
	and blue are described by the tuples <<c(255 0 0)>>, <<c(0 255 0)>>,
	and <<c(0 0 255)>> respectively.

      <P>

      <index/option<and>abbreviation/In addition to synonyms, it is also possible to abbreviate options
      provided that
      the abbreviation is unambiguous.  For example, it is correct to
      abbreviate the <<background>> option by <<ba>> but not by <<b>> since
      <<b>> is also an abbreviation for <<bitmap>> and
      <<borderwidth>>.

    <SubSection>
      <Title/Additional Tk Information/

      <p>
        The full Tk-reference information for each widget is shipped with
        the Mozart distribution. For an example, see the reference information
        for <ref.extern to="&tkcmd;/frame.htm"/<kbd/frame//. 

      <p>
        Reference information on options that are supported by all
        widgets are explained in <ref.extern
        to="&tkcmd;/options.htm"/<kbd/options//.


  <Section id="section.widgets-1.hierarchy">
    <Title/The Widget Hierarchy/

    <para class=apropos><title/masters and slaves/
      Widgets are arranged in a hierarchy.  Each widget has a single
      <def/parent/. The only exceptions can be toplevel widget
      objects, which do not have to have a parent.  The parent of a
      widget is given by the option 
      <<parent>> in the <<tkInit>> message.  Usually parent widgets are
      containers.  To the parent of a widget we also refer to as its
      <def/master/. 
      To the widget itself we refer to as <def/slave/ of its master.

    <P>
      For example, in the previous example shown in <Ptr
      to="figure.widgets-1.relief-frames"> the five frame widgets
      are slaves of the single toplevel widget.

    <P>
      The purpose of the hierarchy is threefold:
      <List enum>
	<Item>
	  The geometry for widgets is computed according to the hierarchy.
	  This is discussed in <Ptr to="chapter.geometry">.
	<Item>
	  Creation and initialization has to follow the hierarchy.  To
	  initialize a widget object it is necessary that its parent widget
	  object is already created and initialized.  Otherwise initialization
	  of a slave blocks until its master is initialized.
	<Item>
	  Closing a parent widget object also closes all its slaves.  The
	  slaves are closed by applying them to the <<tkClose>> message.  A
	  widget object gets closed and its widget gets destroyed only after
	  all of its slaves have been closed. 
      </List>

     <p>
      After a widget object has been closed, using it in tickles sent
      directly to the graphics engine, &eg; by <<Tk.send>> or
      <<Tk.batch>>, issues a runtime error.


  <Section id="section.widgets-1.label">
    <Title/Label Widgets/

    <P>
      A <Def/label/ widget displays a text string or a bitmap.  Options for
      frames are also valid options for labels, additional options determine
      what the label displays. The reference documentation for labels
      is <ref.extern to="&tkcmd/label.htm"/<kbd/label//.

<index class=tails/<<Tk>><and><<font>>/
	<index/option<and><<font>>/A font to be used for displaying text can be specified by the <<font>>
	option. Valid values for the <<font>> option are either
	platform specific font names or instances of the class
	<<Tk.font>>. An instance of the class <<Tk.font>> is also
	a tickle object but is not a widget.

      <p>
        <index/font<and>name/Platform dependent font names are for example X font names. If
        you are running a Unix based system, you can for example
        display the available names by using the <kbd/xlsfonts/
        program.

      <p>
        However the preferred way to specify fonts is to be platform
        independent of course. The program in <Ptr
        to="figure.widgets-1.fonts"> uses this technique.

    <P>
      The program in <Ptr to="figure.widgets-1.images"> creates an image object
      and displays the image in three labels.  Changing the configuration of
      the image, changes the displayed image in all label widgets. For example,
      feeding the following expression
<chunk class=anonymous><title/Tk.image configure/
{I tk(configure file:D#'truck-right.ppm')}
</chunk>
      replaces all three displayed trucks by trucks heading in the inverse
      direction.

    <para class=apropos><title/type and format/
<index/image type/<index/image format/<index/photo/<index/format/<index/<file/gif//<index/<file/ppm//
      Images can be of two different types.  The value of the <<type>>
      configuration option can be <<photo>> (as in our example), or <<bitmap>>.
      If the type is <<photo>>, the image can display files in two different
      formats.  The format is specified by the <<format>> option.  Valid
      values for the <<format>> option are <<gif>> and <<ppm>>.

    <para class=apropos><title/bitmap images/
<index/bitmap/
      In case the value for the <<type>> option is <<bitmap>>, the value given
      for the <<file>> option must be a valid bitmap file.

    <para class=apropos><title/referring to images by URLs/
<index/URL/
      In addition to files, images can also be referred to by
      URLs. For example,
<<<{New Tk.image tkInit(type:photo format:gif
                     url:'http://foo.com/bar.gif'}
>>>
      would have loaded a gif file from the given URL. Note that the
      graphics engine itself is not capable of handling URLs. Instead,
      the image object handles URLs by localizing a URL to
      a local file (see also <ptr.extern to="ozdoc:system"
      key="chapter.resolve">). The local file then is used by the
      graphics engine. 

    <p>
      In <ptr to="section.tools.images"> an
      abstraction is presented that eases the handling of images
      considerably.

    <para class=apropos><title/aspect and width/
      If the option <<width>> is present, the value (a screen distance, see
      <Ptr to="section.widgets-1.distances">) gives the length of each line.
      If no <<width>> option is present, the aspect ratio between height
      and width of the text is given by the option <<aspect>>.  The value
      specifies the aspect as
      <<<100 * ?{width} / ?{height}>>>
      For example a value of <<100>> means that the text is as high
      as wide, a value of <<200>> means that the text is twice as wide
      as high.
