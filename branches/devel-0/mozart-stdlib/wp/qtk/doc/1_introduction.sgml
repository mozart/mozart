The <<QTk>> module implements a description-based abstraction to help programmers efficiently build graphical user interfaces. Windows are built in a declarative way, expressing the widgets that compose the window along with their geometry. Widgets can be dynamically controlled by handles. Miscellaneous facilities are also provided to facilitate the development of an application's GUI. The <<QTk>> module is dedicated to <EM>Oz 3</EM>. It can be loaded by:
<list>
<item> From the OPI: <<declare [QTk]={Module.link ["x-oz://system/wp/QTk.ozf"]}>>
<item> In a functor, in the <<import>> part: <<import QTk at 'x-oz://system/wp/QTk.ozf'>>
</list>

<section><TITLE>Description-based User Interface Specification</TITLE>

<P>
The QTk module is based on using <EM>descriptions</EM> to define user
interfaces.  A description is an Oz record value.
</P>
<P>
In general, there are three main ways of defining user interfaces:

<LIST>
<ITEM> By means of explicit calls to a user interface toolbox (Tcl/Tk, AWT, GTk, ...).
<ITEM> By means of an Interface Builder, a graphical tool that 
allows to create the interface interactively (Visual tools, Delphi, ...).
<ITEM> By means of <EM>descriptions</EM>.  A description is a data
   structure that defines the user interface (HTML, XML, ...).
</LIST>

QTk uses the description approach, where the descriptions are Oz record
values.  Note that the QTk Prototyper provides an interactive interface; this
regains part of the advantage of using an Interface Builder. The
Macintosh has popularized the notion of "resources", which are
graphical descriptions of user interfaces that correspond to records. 
However, they are intended to be used graphically, through an Interface
Builder.  Consequently they are limited to parts of the user interface known before the execution of the application. Description records on the other hand can be calculated on the fly as needed at runtime by the application.
</P>
<P>
The description approach is particularly useful in a symbolic language
such as Oz that allows easy and concise creation of data structures.
QTk uses record values, which are well supported by Oz.  For example,
the following code defines a record and references it in D:
<<<

   declare
   D=td(button(text:"Show"
               action:proc{$} {Show 'Hello World'} end)
        button(text:"Close"
               action:toplevel#close))

>>>
The record with label <<td>> has two fields that themselves contain
records defining two buttons that are labelled Show and Close. These buttons are linked to the actions of
displaying <<Hello World>> and closing the window.
</P>
<P>
There are at least five advantages to using descriptions:
<LIST>
<ITEM> Descriptions are part of the source language.  The user interface are described without leaving the source language.
<ITEM> It is possible to calculate descriptions at runtime, as dynamically required by the application.
<ITEM> Since descriptions are values, they can be saved in files and
   loaded at will.
<ITEM> Saving descriptions in Ascii form allows them to be inspected and
   edited by humans.
<ITEM> Records in Oz are written in a very concise, symbolic way.  This
   means that the description itself is already a kind of visual
   representation.  As a result, the conceptual distance between the
   description and its user interface meaning is small.
</LIST>
By mixing functions and records, descriptions can be made both concise
and readable.  Here's an example:
<<<

   declare
   In Out

   fun {Txt T H S} 
      lr(glue:nswe
         label(text:T)
         text(handle:H glue:nswe tdscrollbar:S)) 
   end

   fun {But T A} 
      button(glue:we text:T action:A) 
   end

   D=td(tdrubberframe(glue:nswe
           {Txt "Expression" In  false}
           {Txt "Result"     Out true})
        lr(glue:we
           {But "Eval" proc {$} V={E {In get($)}} in {Out set(V)} end}
           {But "Quit" toplevel#close}))

>>>
The functions <<Txt>> and <<But>> shorten the writing of the record <<D>>. 
This defines a window with one rubber frame, two text labels,
two text boxes (including one with scrollbar), two buttons (each with
an action). One of the actions is a procedure that does a calculation
(defined by the function E), the other simply closes the window.  The
text boxes have <<handle>> parameters that give control over these widgets. Here, 
one of the boxes is read (through the <<get>> method) and the
other is written (through the <<set>> method).
