  <Title/Introduction/
  <P>
    This document describes how to connect Mozart applications to the rest of the
    computational world.  Sometimes this is paraphrased as <Span
    class=index/interoperability/.
  <P>
    Interoperability is supported in Mozart by the modules <<Open>> and
    <<OS>>.  The module <<Open>> provides the following classes:
    <List enum>
      <Item>
	The class <<Open.file>> for reading and writing files.
      <Item>
	The class <<Open.socket>> for sending and receiving data over the
	Internet.
      <Item>
	The class <<Open.pipe>> to create operating system processes and to
	communicate with them.
      <Item>
	The class <<Open.text>> for reading and writing texts character by
	character or line by line.  This class can be combined with any of
	the classes from above.
    </List>
  <P>
    Each of these classes is described by a chapter on its own (<Ptr
    to="chapter.files">, <Ptr to="chapter.sockets">, <Ptr to="chapter.pipe">, and <Ptr to="chapter.text">).  The chapters explain
    the basic concepts to use the classes and contain a small example.
    Reference information to the classes can be found as usual 
    in the document <Ptr.Extern to="ozdoc:system" key="chapter.open">.
  <P>
    The module <<OS>> provides procedures for random numbers, for manipulating
    files, directories, sockets, and the like.  The module makes functionality
    found in the operating system available within &Oz;.  Since &Oz; runs both
    on Unix based and Windows based platforms, the functionality provided is
    limited to what is defined by the POSIX.1 Standard&nbsp;<Ptr to="Posix1">.
    Its documentation can be found in  <Ptr.Extern to="ozdoc:system" key="chapter.os">.
  <P>
    It is important to understand the data structures needed for reading,
    writing, and sending.  For this reason <Ptr to="chapter.data"> discusses
    these data structures in some detail.
  <Section>
    <Title/Local Computation Spaces/
    <P>
      There is very little to say about local computation spaces and
      input&slash;output:
    <P class=danger>
      input and output do <Em/not/ work in local computation spaces!
  <Section>
    <Title/Conventions/
    <P>
      Throughout this document we refer to Unix <Span class=index/manual
      pages/ for further information.  For example, <File/open(2)/ means that
      you should look up the manual page with title <Q/open/ in Section&nbsp;2.
      Type <Code proglang=sh/man 2 open/<Note foot/On some systems you have to
      type <Code proglang=sh/man -s 2 open/ instead./ to your Unix shell to
      see the manual page.  In case you are running a Windows based system,
      information can be found in a good Unix book or a book describing the
      POSIX.1 standard (&eg;, <Ptr to="Lewine.91">).
  <Section>
    <Title/The Examples/
    <P>
      This document contains quite a number of examples.  It is recommended to
      read this document and try the examples while reading.
      All the examples collected into a single file can be found 
      <Ref.Extern to="OpenProgramming.oz"/here/.
