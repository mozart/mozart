  <Title/Compiler Engines/
  <P>
    Instances of the <<Compiler.engine>> class are active objects called
    <Def/compiler engines/.  Each object's thread processes all <Def/queries/
    inside its <Def/query queue/ sequentially.
  <P>
    The final class <<Compiler.engine>> inherits from <<Narrator.'class'>>,
    described in <Ptr to="appendix.narrator">.
  <SubSection>
    <Title/Methods of the <<Compiler.engine>> Class/
    <P>
      <List>
	<Entry><<enqueue>>
	<Synopsis>
	  <<enqueue(?+{T} ??{I} &lt;= _)>>
	<Synopsis>
	  <<enqueue(?+{Ts} ??{Is} &lt;= _)>>
	<Item>
	  appends a new query&nbsp;?_{T} to the query queue.  If ?_{T} is
	  an unknown query, an exception is raised immediately.  All of
	  the query's input arguments (the subtrees of&nbsp;?_{T}) are
	  type-checked before it is enqueued.
	<P>
	  Internally, each enqueued query is assigned a unique identification
	  number&nbsp;?_{I}.  This may be used later to remove the query from
	  the queue (unless its execution has already begun or terminated).
	<P>
	  The argument to enqueue may also be a <Em/list/ of queries:
	  These are guaranteed to be executed in sequence without other
	  queries interleaving.  The second argument then returns a list
	  of identification numbers.

	<Entry><<dequeue>>
	<Synopsis>
	  <<dequeue(?+{I})>>
	<Item>
	  dequeues the query with identification number&nbsp;?_{I}, if that
	  query is still waiting in the query queue for execution, else does
	  nothing.

	<Entry><<interrupt>>
	<Synopsis>
	  <<interrupt()>>
	<Item>
	  interrupts execution of the current query.  Does not affect the
	  remaining queue.

	<Entry><<clearQueue>>
	<Synopsis>
	  <<clearQueue()>>
	<Item>
	  flushes the whole remaining queue.  Does not affect the currently
	  processed query (if any).
      </List>
  <SubSection>
    <Title/Queries/
    <P>
      This chapter documents the queries understood by the Mozart Compiler.
    <P>
      Some queries request state information from the compiler engine.
      The following description annotates the corresponding output variables
      with a question mark, although they only become bound when the query
      is actually executed.  If binding an output variable raises an
      exception, an error is reported through the registered listeners
      (see <Ptr to="appendix.narrator">).
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Macro Definitions/
      <List>
	<Entry><<macroDefine(?+{V})>>
	<Item>
	  Add ?_{V} to the set of defined macro names.
	<Entry><<macroUndef(?+{V})>>
	<Item>
	  Remove ?_{V} from the set of defined macro names.
	<Entry><<getDefines(??{PrintNames})>>
	<Item>
	  Return all currently defined macro names as a list, in no
	  particular order.
      </List>
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Compiler Switches/
      <List>
	<Entry><<setSwitch(?+{SwitchName} ?+{B})>>
	<Item>
	  Set the state of the given switch to either <Q class=quasi
	  /on/, if <<?_{B} == true>>, or to <Q class=quasi/off/, if
	  <<?_{B} == false>>.
	<Entry><<getSwitch(?+{SwitchName} ??{B})>>
	<Item>
	  Return the state of the given switch.
	<Entry><<pushSwitches()>>
	<Item>
	  Save the current settings of all switches onto the internal switch
	  state stack.
	<Entry><<popSwitches()>>
	<Item>
	  Restore all switch settings from the topmost element of the
	  internal switch state stack, provided it is not empty, else do
	  nothing.
      </List>
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Compiler Options/
      <List>
	<Entry><<setMaxNumberOfErrors(?+{I})>>
	<Item>
	  Set the maximal number of errors to report for any one compilation
	  before aborting it to&nbsp;?_{I}.  A negative value means never to
	  abort.
	<Entry><<getMaxNumberOfErrors(??{I})>>
	<Item>
	  Return the maximal number of errors to report for any one
	  compilation before aborting it.
	<Entry><<setBaseURL(?+{VU})>>
	<Item>
	  Set the base URL relative to which the <<require>> clause of
	  computed functors is resolved.  A value of <<unit>> means to
	  resolve the imports relative to the location of the file in
	  which the <<functor>> keyword appeared.
	<Entry><<getBaseURL(??{AU})>>
	<Item>
	  Return the base URL relative to which the <<require>> clause of
	  computed functors is resolved.
	<Entry><<setGumpDirectory(?+{VU})>>
	<Item>
	  Set the directory in which Gump output files are created.
	  Can be relative.  <<unit>> means the current working directory.
	<Entry><<getGumpDirectory(??{VU})>>
	<Item>
	  Return the directory in which Gump output files are created.
      </List>
    <Para class=apropos><Title/The Environment/
      <List>
	<Entry><<addToEnv(?+{PrintName} ?_{X})>>
	<Item>
	  Add a binding for a variable with the given print name, and
	  bound to&nbsp;?_{X}, to the environment.
	<Entry><<lookupInEnv(?+{PrintName} ?_{X})>>
	<Item>
	  Look up the binding for the variable with the given print name
	  in the environment and bind ?_{X} to its value.  If it does not
	  exist, report an error.
	<Entry><<removeFromEnv(?+{PrintName})>>
	<Item>
	  Remove the binding for the variable with the given print name
	  from the environment if it exists.
	<Entry><<putEnv(?+{Env})>>
	<Item>
	  Replace the current environment by the one given by ?_{Env}.
	<Entry><<mergeEnv(?+{Env})>>
	<Item>
	  Adjoin ?_{Env} to the current environment, overwriting already
	  existing bindings.
	<Entry><<getEnv(??{Env})>>
	<Item>
	  Return the current environment.
      </List>
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Feeding Source Text/
      <List>
	<Entry><<feedVirtualString(?+{V})>>
	<Item>
	  Evaluate the Oz source code given by the virtual string&nbsp;?_{V}.
	<Entry><<feedVirtualString(?+{V} ?+{R})>>
	<Item>
	  Evaluate the Oz source code given by the virtual string&nbsp;?_{V},
	  returning the resulting value in <<?_{R}.result>> (if the
	  <Code><Span class=ignore>\switch +</Span>expression</Code>
	  switch is set and ?_{R} has the feature <<result>>).
	<Entry><<feedFile(?+{V})>>
	<Item>
	  Evaluate the Oz source code contained in the file with
	  name&nbsp;?_{V}.
	<Entry><<feedFile(?+{V} ?+{R})>>
	<Item>
	  Evaluate the Oz source code contained in the file with
	  name&nbsp;?_{V}, returning the resulting value in
	  <<?_{R}.result>> (if the <Code><Span class=ignore
	  /\switch +/expression</Code> switch is set and ?_{R}
	  has the feature <<result>>).
      </List>
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Synchronization/
      <List>
	<Entry><<ping(??{U})>>
	<Item>
	  Bind the variable ?_{U} to <<unit>> on execution of this
	  query.  This allows to synchronize on the work of the compiler,
	  &eg;, to be informed when a compilation is finished.
	<Entry><<ping(??{U} ?_{X})>>
	<Item>
	  Works like the <<ping(_)>> query, except gives a value which
	  will reappear in the response notification sent to interfaces.
	  This allows to identify the <<ping>> query with its <<pong>>
	  notification.
      </List>
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Custom Front-Ends/
      <List>
	<Entry><<setFrontEnd(?+{ParseFileP} ?+{ParseVirtualStringP})>>
	<Item>
	  Replace the front-end used by the compiler by a custom
	  front-end implemented by procedures ?_{ParseFileP} and
	  ?_{ParseVirtualStringP}.  These procedures have the
	  same signature as <<Compiler.parseOzFile>> and
	  <<Compiler.parseOzVirtualString>>, documented above.
	  Indeed, these procedures implement the default Oz front-end.
