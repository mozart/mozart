			    OZ GDBM MODULE

GDBM is the GNU DBM database utility.  This module implements an
interface which permits the user to save/recover Oz (stateless) values
into/from such a database.

			     INSTALLATION

ozmkmf
make
make install

At the PS Lab: ozmkmf -DPS
to automatically resolve libgdbm according to our local installation.
Elsewhere, you can supply -D options to ozmkmf, e.g.:

ozmkmf -DINCS='-I/opt/gnu/include' -DLIBS='/opt/gnu/lib/libgdbm.a -lc'

			    INSTANTIATION

The GDBM module must be instantiated with Standard.
declare GDBM = {{Load URL_of_GDBM_component} Standard}
URL_of_GDBM_component might be:
	file:$(OZHOME)/tool/gdbm/gdbm.ozc
where $(OZHOME) might be:
	/project/ps/soft/oz-devel/oz

			    DOCUMENTATION

{New GDBM init(	name     :Name
		flags    :Flags<=[create]
		mode     :Mode <=mode(owner:[write] all:[read])
		blockSize:Block<=unit )
	  ?X}

	binds X to an object that interfaces with a gdbm database.
	The arguments to init(...) are similar to those for the Open
	module. `flags' are taken from [read write create truncate
	new fast]. `blockSize' is described in the gdbm: it represents
	the size of a transfer from disk to memory; it has effect only
	when a new database is being created.

{X get(Key ?Val)}

	Key must be an atom or an integer.  Val is the Oz value that
	was saved in the database under this key.

{X put(Key Val replace:R<=true)}

	Saves Val under Key in the database.  The optional argument
	`replace' indicates whether to overwrite the entry for Key
	should it already exist.  If `replace' is not true, exception
	keyExists may be raised.  If the put failed for some other
	reason, exception putFailed will be raised.

{X del(Key)}

	deletes the entry for Key (if it exists).  If the operation
	failes for some other reason, exception delFailed is raised.

{X close}

	closes the gdbm database.  It doesn't makes sense to use X
	after this.

{X firstkey(?Key)}

	This operation is used to begin iterating over the keys in the
	database: it returns the first key present in the database.
	Which is considered first is implementation dependent and
	should not be relied upon; it may well change as a result of
	other operations.

{X nextkey(Key ?NextKey)}

	returns the next key after Key. Similar caveats apply as
	above.

{X reorganize}

	After many updates (e.g. deletions), it may be profitable to
	reorganize the database.  May raise exception
	reorganizeFailed.
