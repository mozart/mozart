	list widget.

1999-03-27  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* Makefile.am (test): New target.  Use this to run `test-gnome' in
	$srcdir.  This should be better than Miguel's fix below.
	(test-debug): Similar, but runs gdb on the test-gnome binary.

1999-03-25  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas-primitives.c: Do not make me look like a dofus on a
	demostration not ran from $cwd.

1999-02-12  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas-primitives.c (create_canvas_primitives): Create the

	makes the widget item test work on multivisual machines.

1999-02-10  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* testgnome.c (create_pixmap): Use a gnome_pixmap.  Why we were
	using a gtk_pixmap here is a mistery for the Big Manatee.

1999-02-10  James Henstridge  <james@daa.com.au>

	* testgnome.c(create_icon_list): do not add a viewport for the icon
	list when adding it to the scrolled window -- it exports its own
	scrolling behaviour.

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): s%$(datadir)/locale%$(gnomelocaledir)%

1999-01-15  Szekeres István <szekeres@cyberspace.mht.bme.hu>

        we can enable it.

1999-01-02  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* canvas-fifteen.c:
	Silence uninitialized-var warnings.

Thu Dec 31 23:41:57 1998  Raph Levien  <raph@gimp.org>

	* canvas-primitives.c: more changes for antialiased rendering

	* canvas-primitives.c: added support for antialiased rendering.

	* canvas.c: added an "Antialias" notebook tab for testing the
	aa rendering back-end.

1998-12-01  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* testgnome.c (help_menu): Removed the GNOME_APP_UI_HELP, since it
	is not used and I got tired of the stupid warnings.

1998-11-29  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* testgnome.c (create_icon_list): IconList now starts life in
	normal state.

1998-11-16  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* testgnome.c (create_icon_list): Insert the icon list in a
	scrolled window, now that it can handle the scrollbars for us.

	GnomeIconList.

1998-09-27  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	scrolling region correctly.
	* canvas-arrowhead.c (create_canvas_arrowhead): Likewise.

	* canvas-primitives.c (item_event): Drag the right way, not the

	necessary changes for the new canvas.
	(create_canvas_primitives): Use scrollbars instead of the stupid
	scroll buttons we had before.  Removed the scroll() and

1998-07-29  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas-arrowhead.c (create_canvas_arrowhead): New spiffy test
	for the arrows in the line item.  It's a clone of Tk's arrowhead
	editor.  It exposes a few bugs in the arrowheads, which I will be
	fixing shortly.

	* canvas-primitives.c:
	* canvas-arrowhead.c:
	* canvas-fifteen.c: New files.  I split up the canvas.c file
	because it was getting too big.  Users may have an easier time
	looking at the canvas demo sources this way.

	functions.

	* Makefile.am: Added the new files to the sources.

1998-07-28  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	setup_images(), and setup_lines().

1998-07-19  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas.c (item_event): Use gnome_canvas_item_raise_to_top() and
	gnome_canvas_item_lower_to_bottom().

1998-07-15  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas.c (item_event): Grab/ungrab the item on button
	press/release, respectively.
	(item_event): Now you can click buttons 2 or 3 on an item to

	item will be sent to the bottom/top of the stack.

	* testgnome.c (main): Do not call gnome_init() and gtk_init().

1998-07-13  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas.c (piece_event): 
	(create_primitives): 
	(create_fifteen): Removed the "SomeGtkType::" prefixes for
	arguments now that Gtk supports direct argument lookups.  The code
	is actually nice right now :-)

Sun Jul 12 23:01:56 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* testgnome.c (create_app_util): Added a test for the 
	GnomeAppBar, gnome-app-util, and gnome-dialog-util (they're 
	all interrelated, so it's just one test window). This is also
	a decent demo for what these functions do (or don't).

	Also added a "Reload preferences" button to load preferences
	and observe the effect on the gnome libraries.

1998-07-08  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas.c (scroll): Added buttons to scroll the canvas.  When I
	think of how to make a decent adjustment system for the canvas,
	these will be replace by scrollbars.

1998-07-07  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas.c (zoom_changed): Added a scale to change the zoom
	factor.  This exposes several bugs in the canvas, which I will be
	fixing shortly.

1998-07-06  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas.c (scramble): Don't flush the X queue now that
	gnome_canvas_update_now() does it for us.
	(create_primitives): Added a test for all the canvas primitives.

1998-07-05  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas.c: Added text to the fifteen game.  The text items change
	color when the mouse enters/leaves the squares.
	(scramble): Added function to scramble the board.

1998-07-01  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas.c (piece_event): Use gnome_canvas_item_move instead of
	re-setting the coordinates explicitly.

1998-06-30  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas.c: Implemented a simple "fifteen" game.  You can move the
	pieces and reorder them to win.  It does not have text yet,
	because I haven't written a GnomeCanvasText item type yet.

	* canvas.c: New test for new canvas -- work in progress.

1998-06-22  Richard Hestilow  <hestgray@ionet.net>
	
	* testgnome.c: 	Fixed icon list (create_icon_list) and changed
			create_pixmap to use gdk_imlib.

	and build directories.

1998-05-30  Marius Vollmer  <mvo@zagadka.ping.de>

	* testgnome.c (create_newwin): Do not connect to the
	"delete_event" when being NORMAL.  This was causing segfaults left
	and right.

Wed Jun 10 14:19:39 EDT 1998 Gregory McLean <gregm@comstar.net>

	* fixed up this so that the canvas is only built if it was built in 
	  libgnomeui.

1998-06-09  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* Makefile.am (testgnome_LDADD): Made it use the libraries from
	the build directories.

Sat Jun  6 13:55:49 CEST 1998  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	* testgnome.c (create_lamp): added call to gnome_lamp_set_window_type.

Tue Jun  2 00:51:58 CEST 1998  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	* testgnome.c (create_lamp): adjusted sequence value.

1998-05-27  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* canvas.c: New file to test the canvas.  It is on a separate file
	because it will have a lot of stuff.

	* testgnome.h: New file with declarations useful to the whole program.

Sat May 23 22:10:23 1998  Havoc Pennington  <hp@pobox.com>

	* testgnome.c: Add a more comprehensive dialog test.

Thu May 21 18:51:02 CEST 1998  Eckehard Berns  <eb@berns.prima.de>

	(main): added GnomeLamp test.

1998-05-11  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	pointer.  Add a routine to close the window, and not quit the
	program.
