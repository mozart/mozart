usage: ozmake OPTIONS TARGETS

ozmake is a tool for building Mozart-based projects and for creating
and installing Mozart packages.  It was inspired by the Unix tools
`make' and `rpm', but is much, much simpler and specialized for
Mozart-based software development and deployment.

ozmake must currently be invoked from a shell, but it will eventually
acquire additionally an optional, user-friendly graphical interface.

MAKEFILE

The makefile contains a single Oz record which describes the project
and should normally be placed in a file called `makefile.oz'.  A
makefile typically looks like this:

        makefile(
          lib : ['Foo.ozf']
          uri : 'x-ozlib://mylib')

stating explicitly that there is one library target, namely the
functor Foo.ozf, and that it should installed at URI:

        x-ozlib://mylib/Foo.ozf

and implicitly that it should be compiled from the Oz source file
Foo.oz.

There are many more features which can occur in the makefile and they
are all optional.  If you omit all the features, you only get the
defaults and you don't even need a makefile.  All values, suchs as
files, should be given as virtual string; atoms are recommended except
for features blurb, info_text and info_html, where strings are
recommended.

        makefile(
          bin      : [ FILES... ]
          lib      : [ FILES... ]
          doc      : [ FILES... ]
          src      : [ FILES... ]
          depends  :
             o( FILE : [ FILES... ]
                ...
              )
          rules    :
             o( FILE : TOOL(FILE)
                ...
              )
          clean    : [ GLOB... ]
          veryclean: [ GLOB... ]
          uri      : URI
          mogul    : MOGUL
          author   : [ AUTHORS... ]
          released : DATE
          blurb    : TEXT
          info_text: TEXT
          info_html: TEXT
        )

Features bin, lib and doc list targets to be installed in <BINDIR>,
<LIBDIR> and <DOCDIR> respectively.  bin targets should be executable
functors, i.e. they should end with extension `.exe'.  lib targets are
typically compiled functors i.e. ending with extension `.ozf', but
could also be native functors, i.e. ending with extension `.so', or
simply data files.  doc targets are documentation files.

EXTENSIONS

ozmake knows how to build targets by looking at the target's
extension:

Foo.exe   is an executable functor and is created from Foo.ozf
Foo.ozf   is a compiled functor and is created from Foo.oz
Foo.o     is a compiled C++ file and is created from Foo.cc
Foo.so    is a native functor and is created from Foo.o
Foo.cc    is a C++ source file
Foo.hh    is a C++ header file

Note that these are `abstract' targets.  In particular, Foo.so really
denotes the files Foo.so-<PLATFORM> where <PLATFORM> identifies the
architecture and operating system where the package is built; for
example: linux-i486.  Also, when a bin target Foo.exe is installed, it
is installed both as <BINDIR>/Foo.exe and <BINDIR>Foo so that it can
be invoked as Foo on both Windows and Unix platforms.

It is imperative that you respect the conventional use of extensions
described here: ozmake permits no variation and supports no other
extensions.

RULES

ozmake has built-in rules for building files.  Occasionally, you may
want to override the default rule for one or more targets.  This is
done with feature `rule' which contains a record mapping target to
rule:
        TARGET_FILE : TOOL(SOURCE_FILE)

the rule may also have a list of options:

        TARGET_FILE : TOOL(SOURCE_FILE OPTIONS)

The tools supported by ozmake are ozc (Oz compiler), ozl (Oz linker),
cc (C++ compiler), ld (C++ linker).  The default rules are:

        'Foo.exe' : ozl('Foo.ozf' [executable])
        'Foo.ozf' : ozc('Foo.oz')
        'Foo.o'   : cc('Foo.cc')
        'Foo.so'  : ld('Foo.o')

currently ozc and ozl support option `executable'.

You might want to specify a rule to create a pre-linked library:

        'Utils.ozf' : ozl('Foo.ozf')

or to create a non-prelinked executable:

        'Foo.exe' : ozc('Foo.oz' [executable])

DEPENDENCIES

ozmake automatically determines whether targets needed to be rebuilt,
e.g. because they are missing or if some source file needed to create
them has been modified.  The rules are used to determine dependencies
between files.  Sometimes this is insufficient e.g. because you use
tool ozl (dependencies on imports), or \insert in an Oz file, or
#include in a C++ file.  In this case you can specify additional
dependencies using feature `depends' which is a record mapping targets
to list of dependencies:

        TARGET : [ FILES... ]

For example:

        'Foo.o' : [ 'Foo.hh' 'Baz.hh' ]
or      'Foo.exe' : [ 'Lib1.ozf' 'Lib2.ozf' ]

CLEANING

During development, it is often convenient to be able to easily remove
all junk and compiled files to obtain again a clean project directory.
This is supported by ozmake --clean and ozmake --veryclean; the latter
also implies the former.  Files to be removed are specified by `glob'
patterns where `?' matches any 1 character and `*' matches a sequence
of 0 or more characters.  All files in <BUILDDIR> matching one such
pattern is removed.  There are built-in patterns, but ou can override
them with features `clean' and `veryclean' which should be lists of
glob patterns.  For example the default clean glob patterns are:

        clean : [ "*~" "*.ozf" "*.o" "*.so-*" "*.exe" ]

PACKAGE RELATED FEATURES

URI

feature `uri' indicates the URI where to install lib targets.  For
example:

        uri : 'x-ozlib://mylib/XML'

states that all lib targets (e.g. Foo.ozf) will be installed under
this URI so that they can also be imported from it, i.e.:

       import MyFoo at 'x-ozlib://mylib/XML/Foo.ozf'

MOGUL

feature `mogul' is the mogul id uniquely identifying this package.  It
is used to create/publish this package and to install the documention
files.

AUTHOR

feature `author' is a virtual string or list of virtual string
resp. identifying the author or authors of the package.  It is
recommended to identify authors by their mogul id, however is is also
possible to simply give their names.  For example:

recommended:        author : 'mogul:/duchier'
also possible:      author : 'Denys Duchier'

RELEASED

feature `released' is a virtual string specifying the date and time of
release in the following format:

        released : "YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS"

time is optional.  An appropriate release date using the currentdate
and time is automatically inserted when invoking ozmake --create or
ozmake --publish.

BLURB

feature `blurb' contains a very short piece of text describing the
package.  This text should be just one line and is intended to be used
as a title when the package is published in the mogul archive.

INFO_TEXT

feature `info_text' contains a plain text description of the package.
This is intended to be used as an abstract on the presentation page
for the package in the mogul archive.  It should be brief and
informative, but should not attempt to document the package.

INFO_HTML

feature `info_html' is similar to `info_text' but contains HTML rather
than plain text.

SRC

feature `src' indicates which targets should be considered source,
i.e. in particular non-buildable.  All targets mentioned in src should
be mentioned in bin, lib, or doc too.  The point of src is to support
distributing packages with pre-built targets and without giving out
the corresponding sources.  You should not do this with native
functors since they are platform dependent and not portable, but it
can be a convenient means of distributing prebuilt Oz libraries. For
example:

        makefile(
          lib : [ 'Foo.ozf' ]
          src : [ 'Foo.ozf' ]
          uri : 'x-ozlib://mylib'
          mogul : 'mogul:/myname/foolib')

is a makefile for a package that distribute the precompiled Foo.ozf,
but does not also distribute its source Foo.oz.  Normally, when you
build a package it simply checks that the src files are present but
will not attempt to build them.  If you have the sources, you can
force building the src targets if necessary using --fullbuild.
