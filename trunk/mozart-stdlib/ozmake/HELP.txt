USAGE

   ozmake OPTIONS TARGETS

   ozmake  is  a tool for building Mozart-based projects and for creating
   and installing Mozart packages. It was inspired by the Unix tools make
   and  rpm,  but  is much, much simpler and specialized for Mozart-based
   software development and deployment.

   ozmake  must currently be invoked from a shell, but it will eventually
   acquire additionally an optional, user-friendly graphical interface.

  Uninstall

   ozmake --uninstall
          uninstall package described by makefile

   ozmake --uninstall --package=PKG
          uninstall package named by mogul id PKG

   ozmake --veryclean *~ *.ozf *.o *.so-* *.exe
          remove files as specified by the makefile's clean and veryclean
          features. --veryclean implies --clean.

  Create

   ozmake --create --package=<FILE>
          create  a  package  and save it in <FILE>. the files needed for
          the package are automatically computed from the makefile.

   --include(bins|libs|docs), --exclude(bins|libs|docs)
          control which target types are included in the package

  Publish

   ozmake --publish
          create   a  package  and  place  it  in  the  user's  area  for
          publication in the mogul archive

  Extract

   ozmake --extract --package=<PKG>
          extract the files from file or URL PKG. if <PKG> is a mogul id,
          then  the  package  is  automatically downloaded from the mogul
          archive

  List

   ozmake --list
          list info for all packages in the installed package database

   ozmake --list --package=<MOGUL>
          list  info  for  the  installed package indentified by mogul id
          <MOGUL>

   --linewidth=N
          default: 70
          assume a line with of N characters

  Config

   ozmake --config=set <OPTIONS>
          record  the given <OPTIONS> in ozmake's configuration database,
          and  use  them  as defaults in subsequent invocations of ozmake
          unless  explicitly  overriden on the command line. For example:
          ozmake  --config=set --prefix=/usr/local/oz saves /usr/local/oz
          as the default value for option --prefix

   ozmake --config=unset <OPT1> ... <OPTn>
          deletes  some  entries  from  the  configuration  database. For
          example:  ozmake  --config=unset prefix removes the default for
          --prefix from the configuration database

   ozmake --config=list
          lists the contents of ozmake's configuration database

MAKEFILE

   The  makefile  contains a single Oz record which describes the project
   and should normally be placed in a file called makefile.oz. A makefile
   typically looks like this:
        makefile(
          lib : ['Foo.ozf']
          uri : 'x-ozlib://mylib'
          mogul : 'mogul:/denys/lib-foo')

   stating  explicitly  that  there  is  one  library  target, namely the
   functor Foo.ozf, and that it should installed at URI:
        x-ozlib://mylib/Foo.ozf

   and  implicitly  that  it  should  be compiled from the Oz source file
   Foo.oz.  When you invoke ozmake --install, the mogul feature serves to
   uniquely  identify  this  package  and the files it contributes in the
   ozmake database of installed packages.

   There  are many more features which can occur in the makefile and they
   are  all  optional.  If  you  omit  all the features, you only get the
   defaults  and  you  don't  even  need a makefile. All values, suchs as
   files, should be given as virtual string; atoms are recommended except
   for  features  blurb,  info_text  and  info_html,  where  strings  are
   recommended.
        makefile(
          bin      : [ FILES... ]
          lib      : [ FILES... ]
          doc      : [ FILES... ]
          src      : [ FILES... ]
          depends  :
             o( FILE : [ FILES... ]
                ...
              )
          rules    :
             o( FILE : TOOL(FILE)
                ...
              )
          clean     : [ GLOB... ]
          veryclean : [ GLOB... ]
          uri       : URI
          mogul     : MOGUL
          author    : [ AUTHORS... ]
          released  : DATE
          blurb     : TEXT
          info_text : TEXT
          info_html : TEXT
          subdirs   : [ DIRS... ]
          requires  : [ MOGUL... ]
          categories: [ CATEGORY... ]
          version   : VERSION
        )

   Features  bin,  lib  and doc list targets to be installed in <BINDIR>,
   <LIBDIR>  and  <DOCDIR> respectively. bin targets should be executable
   functors,  i.e.  they  should end with extension .exe. lib targets are
   typically compiled functors i.e. ending with extension .ozf, but could
   also  be  native  functors,  i.e. ending with extension .so, or simply
   data files. doc targets are documentation files.

  Extensions

   ozmake  knows  how  to  build  targets  by  looking  at  the  target's
   extension:
   Foo.exe
          is an executable functor and is created from Foo.ozf
   Foo.ozf
          is a compiled functor and is created from Foo.oz
   Foo.o
          is a compiled C++ file and is created from Foo.cc
   Foo.so
          is a native functor and is created from Foo.o
   Foo.cc
          is a C++ source file
   Foo.hh
          is a C++ header file

   Note  that  these  are  abstract targets. In particular, Foo.so really
   denotes  the  file  Foo.so-<PLATFORM>  where <PLATFORM> identifies the
   architecture  and  operating  system  where  the package is built; for
   example:  linux-i486. Also, when a bin target Foo.exe is installed, it
   is  installed both as <BINDIR>/Foo.exe and <BINDIR>/Foo so that it can
   be invoked as Foo on both Windows and Unix platforms.

   It  is  imperative that you respect the conventional use of extensions
   described  here:  ozmake  permits  no  variation and supports no other
   extensions.

  Rules

   ozmake  has  built-in  rules for building files. Occasionally, you may
   want  to  override  the  default rule for one or more targets. This is
   done with feature rule which contains a record mapping target to rule:
        TARGET_FILE : TOOL(SOURCE_FILE)

   the rule may also have a list of options:
        TARGET_FILE : TOOL(SOURCE_FILE OPTIONS)

   The  tools supported by ozmake are ozc (Oz compiler), ozl (Oz linker),
   cc (C++ compiler), ld (C++ linker). The default rules are:
        'Foo.exe' : ozl('Foo.ozf' [executable])
        'Foo.ozf' : ozc('Foo.oz')
        'Foo.o'   : cc('Foo.cc')
        'Foo.so'  : ld('Foo.o')

   The tools support the following options:
   ozc
        executable
               make the result executable
   ozl
        executable
               make the result executable
   cc
        include(DIR)
               Similar  to  the usual C++ compiler option -IDIR. DIR is a
               virtual string
        'define'(MAC)
               Similar  to  the usual C++ compiler option -DMAC. MAC is a
               virtual string
   ld
        library(DIR)
               Similar  to  the  usual  C++ linker option -lDIR. DIR is a
               virtual string

   You might want to specify a rule to create a pre-linked library:
        'Utils.ozf' : ozl('Foo.ozf')

   or to create a non-prelinked executable:
        'Foo.exe' : ozc('Foo.oz' [executable])

  Dependencies

   ozmake  automatically determines whether targets needed to be rebuilt,
   e.g.  because they are missing or if some source file needed to create
   them  has  been modified. The rules are used to determine dependencies
   between  files.  Sometimes  this  is insufficient e.g. because you use
   tool  ozl  (dependencies  on  imports),  or  \insert in an Oz file, or
   #include  in  a  C++  file.  In  this  case you can specify additional
   dependencies  using  feature depends which is a record mapping targets
   to list of dependencies:
        TARGET : [ FILES... ]

   For example:
        'Foo.o' : [ 'Foo.hh' 'Baz.hh' ]

   or
        'Foo.exe' : [ 'Lib1.ozf' 'Lib2.ozf' ]

  Cleaning

   During development, it is often convenient to be able to easily remove
   all junk and compiled files to obtain again a clean project directory.
   This is supported by ozmake --clean and ozmake --veryclean; the latter
   also  implies  the  former.  Files to be removed are specified by glob
   patterns where ? matches any 1 character and * matches a sequence of 0
   or more characters. All files in BUILDDIR matching one such pattern is
   removed.  There  are  built-in patterns, but ou can override them with
   features  clean  and veryclean which should be lists of glob patterns.
   For example the default clean glob patterns are:
        clean : [ "*~" "*.ozf" "*.o" "*.so-*" "*.exe" ]

  Package Related Features

    uri

   feature  uri  indicates  the  URI  where  to  install lib targets. For
   example:
        uri : 'x-ozlib://mylib/XML'

   states  that  all  lib  targets (e.g. Foo.ozf) will be installed under
   this URI so that they can also be imported from it, i.e.:
       import MyFoo at 'x-ozlib://mylib/XML/Foo.ozf'

    mogul

   feature mogul is the mogul id uniquely identifying this package. It is
   used to identify the package in the database of installed packages, to
   create/publish the package, and to install its documention files.

    author

   feature  author  is  a  virtual string or list of virtual string resp.
   identifying the author or authors of the package. It is recommended to
   identify  authors  by  their  mogul id, however is is also possible to
   simply give their names. For example, the recommended way is:
        author : 'mogul:/duchier'

   but the following is also possible:
        author : 'Denys Duchier'

    released

   feature  released  is a virtual string specifying the date and time of
   release in the following format:
        released : "YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS"

   time  is  optional.  An appropriate release date using the currentdate
   and  time  is  automatically inserted when invoking ozmake --create or
   ozmake --publish.

    blurb

   feature  blurb  contains  a  very  short  piece of text describing the
   package.  This text should be just one line and is intended to be used
   as a title when the package is published in the mogul archive.

    info_text

   feature  info_text  contains  a plain text description of the package.
   This  is  intended  to be used as an abstract on the presentation page
   for  the  package  in  the  mogul  archive.  It  should  be  brief and
   informative, but should not attempt to document the package.

    info_html

   feature  info_html  is  similar  to info_text but contains HTML rather
   than plain text.

    src

   feature  src indicates which targets should be considered source, i.e.
   in  particular  non-buildable.  All targets mentioned in src should be
   mentioned  in  bin,  lib,  or  doc too. The point of src is to support
   distributing  packages  with  pre-built targets and without giving out
   the corresponding sources. You should not do this with native functors
   since  they  are  platform dependent and not portable, but it can be a
   convenient means of distributing prebuilt Oz libraries. For example:
        makefile(
          lib : [ 'Foo.ozf' ]
          src : [ 'Foo.ozf' ]
          uri : 'x-ozlib://mylib'
          mogul : 'mogul:/myname/foolib')

   is  a  makefile for a package that distribute the precompiled Foo.ozf,
   but  does  not  also  distribute its source Foo.oz. Normally, when you
   build  a  package  it simply checks that the src files are present but
   will not attempt to build them. If you have the sources, you can force
   building the src targets if necessary using --fullbuild.

    subdirs

   feature   subdirs   is   a   list   of   bare  filenames  representing
   subdirectories of the project. By default, when necessary, ozmake will
   recurse   into   these   subdirectories.  It  is  expected  that  each
   subdirectory  should  provide  its  own  makefile.  The  mogul  id  is
   automatically inherited to subdirectories and the uri is automatically
   extended  by appending the name of the subdirectory: thus submakefiles
   can   be   simpler   since  they  don't  need  to  be  concerned  with
   package-level features.

    requires

   feature  requires is a list of module URIs or package MOGUL ids. These
   represent  the  external dependencies of the package. They are not yet
   used,  but  eventually ozmake will be able to use them to automate the
   recursive  installation  of other packages required by the one you are
   interested in.

    categories

   feature  categories  is  a list of MOGUL categories to help categorize
   this package in the MOGUL archive.

    version

   feature  version is used to provide a version string. This is a string
   that  consist  of  integers  separated  by  single  dots,  e.g. "2" or
   "3.1.7".
