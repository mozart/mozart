<Chapter id="chapter.windows">
  <Title/Microsoft Windows/
  <P>
    Get the self-extracting executable from the
    <Ref.Extern to="http://www.mozart-oz.org/download/view.cgi?action=windows"
    /download page/, execute it, and follow the on-screen instructions.
    You should glance over the following section to see if there are any
    caveats or additional requirements for your system.
  <Section>
    <Title/Installation Caveats/
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Previous Versions/
      Uninstall any previous release of Mozart you have on your system.
      If your previous version was pre-1.1.0-RC1, reboot your machine after
      uninstalling.
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Online Help/
      Documentation is distributed in CHM format.  To read it, you need
      Microsoft's HTML Help, bundled with newer versions of Microsoft
      Windows.  HTML Help can also be downloaded <Ref.Extern
      to="http://www.mozart-oz.org/download/mozart-ftp/extras/hhupd.exe"/here/.
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Windows Installer/
      Mozart setup uses the Windows Installer, which also comes with
      Office 2000 and Windows 2000 or newer.  If you do not have Windows
      Installer on your system, download the Mozart setup <File/exe/
      provided on the download page and Windows Installer will be installed
      automatically.  On some systems, this requires a reboot.
    <P>
      We have received reports where Mozart setup failed to install Windows
      Installer on NT4.  If you are running NT4, please perform the following
      steps <Em/before/ running Mozart setup:
      <List enum>
	<Item>Download the Windows Installer redistributable, <Ref.Extern
	  to="http://www.mozart-oz.org/download/mozart-ftp/extras/instmsiW.exe"
	  /<File/instmsiW.exe// for Windows NT4 or <Ref.Extern
	  to="http://www.mozart-oz.org/download/mozart-ftp/extras/instmsiA.exe"
	  /<File/instmsiA.exe// for Windows 95/98.
	<Item>Run this file and reboot your machine.
	<Item>Run Mozart setup.  Should you get the error message
	   <Q/The Windows Installer service failed to start/,
	   then please perform <Ref.Extern
	   to="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q251/2/74.ASP"
	   /this workaround/ described by Microsoft before running Mozart
	   setup again.
      </List>
    <Para class=apropos><Title/Windows 98/
      Due to a bug in the Windows Installer service, the <File/AUTOEXEC.BAT/
      file may be modified in the wrong way, resulting in boot problems.
      You should either:
      <List>
	<Item>make sure before installing that your <File/AUTOEXEC.BAT/
	  uses the <Samp/set PATH=/&ellipsis; syntax and <Em/not/ the
	  <Samp/PATH=/&ellipsis; syntax; or
	<Item>review the changes made to <File/AUTOEXEC.BAT/ after
	  installation and before rebooting.
      </List>
  <Section>
    <Title/Obtaining and Installing GNU Emacs/
    <P>
      If you want to develop applications yourself using the Oz Programming
      Interface, then you need GNU Emacs or XEmacs.  From the <Ref.Extern
      to="http://www.mozart-oz.org/download/view.cgi?action=windows"
      /Mozart download page/, you can also obtain an installer for
      GNU Emacs.  Execute it and follow the instructions.
    <P>
      If you obtained GNU Emacs from somewhere else in <File/.tgz/ or
      <File/.tar.gz/ format, then make sure you run <File/addpm.exe/ from
      Emacs' <File/bin/ directory before starting the Oz Programming
      Interface.
    <P>
    When the Oz programming environment starts, it tries to invoke
    Emacs via the command <<emacs>>.  If your version of Emacs
    has to be invoked with a different command name, say <<runemacs>>,
    you can achieve this by setting the environment variable <Var type=env
    /OZEMACS/ in your <File/AUTOEXEC.BAT/, for example
    <<<OZEMACS=F:\Programs\emacs-21.1\bin\runemacs.exe>>>
    <P>
      More information on GNU Emacs for Windows can be found at
      <Ref.Extern to="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html"
      >http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/ntemacs.html</Ref.Extern>.
