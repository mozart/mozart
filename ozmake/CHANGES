-*-outline-*-

* version 0.86
  complete rework of the computation of dependencies. e.g. to take
  into account the run-time dependencies of build-time dependencies.
  fixed bug in package creation with circular imports.

* version 0.85
  for autodepend to work as expected, the build rule for ozl needs to
  consider all the recursive dependencies.

* version 0.84
  fixed a bug introduced by 0.83.  The explicit "depends" in the makefile.oz
  were being ignored.

* version 0.83
** ozmake will now automatically compute build-time and install-time
   dependencies, but sofar only for Oz sources.  This can be
   controlled by --(no)autodepend, which is true by default.

* version 0.82
** honor new OZ_DOTOZ introduced in Mozart 1.2.4

* version 0.81.4
** forgot to enter changes
** gumpdir support still unusable in 1.2.3. turned off
** --publish: don't try to install docs when there is none
   otherwise publishing contact complains about missing mogul id
** don't try to chdir in dry-run mode (the dir may be missing)

* version 0.79
** fixed "fast" compiler invocation to also pass debug switch

* version 0.78
** automatically remove spurious trailing slashes on MOGUL IDs.
** `provides' in submakefiles are now really not forgotten

* version 0.77
** --fast is now `really' the default
** Renamed Makefile.oz to Makefiler.oz to avoid clash with makefile.oz on case
   insensitive systems
** fixed bug in --install version checking

* version 0.76
** ozmake --publish will now publish the package both under the bare filename
   derived from the mogul id and from the same augmented with the
   version number if any.
** ozmake --install will compare both version and date to determine if the
   package to be installed is newer than the installed
   version. version is more significant than date.
** --packageversion=VERSION is now respected by --extract and --install.
   when --extract downloads from the MOGUL archive, it will look for
   the given version of the package.  --install will signal an error
   if the package to be installed doesn't have the given version.
** --fast is now the default.  --slow gets back the old behaviour, just in
   case someone discovers a problem.
** version and requires now are actually put in the database

* version 0.75
** ozmake --create will now automatically pick a package filename if none
   is given: it will be formed using the mogul id and the version number
   if any.
** ozmake --mogul=export now checks that there is no section entry that
   has the same mogul id as a package or contact.
** more checks are applied to the `author' feature to make sure that
   they don't contain a stupid mistake
** order is now preserved in `requires'
** ozmake --extract -p MOG will now properly download the package denoted
   by mogul id MOG from the MOGUL archive (if it was published using
   ozmake --publish, i.e. follows the right naming convention).
** ozmake --fast will invoke the compiler module directly without spawning
   a new process each time.  This is easily 2 to 3 times faster.

* version 0.74
** `requires' field now properly saved in mogul.db and is properly exported
** pkg files are now compressed and much smaller
** makefiles now support the `provides' feature to override the default
   computed from the bin and lib features.  Note that the `provides' feature
   of a makefile does not also override its submakefiles; each one should
   supply its own `provides' if desired.  `provides:nil' is a simple way of
   indicating that the makefile provides no public functors or executables.

* version 0.73
** makefiles now support the 'contact' feature to specify MOGUL contact
   information:

       makefile(
         ...
         contact :
           o(
              mogul : 'mogul:/duchier/denys'
              name  : 'Denys Duchier'
              email : 'duchier@ps.uni-sb.de'
              www   : 'http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~duchier/'))

   the value on the contact feature can also be a list of records as shown
   above.  A makefile with contact info need not also actually provide anything
   else (like modules): instead, it can be used to automatically generate MOGUL
   entries (see below).
** ozmake --mogul=... now permits to manage the MOGUL entries associated with
   packages you provide.
*** ozmake --mogul=put
    ozmake --mogul=put -p PKG
    update the user's database of own MOGUL contributions with current or
    given package
*** ozmake --mogul=delete
*** ozmake --mogul=delete -p PKG
*** ozmake --mogul=delete MOG1 ... MOGn
    delete some entries from the user's database of own MOGUL contributions
*** ozmake --mogul=list
*** ozmake --mogul=list MOG1 ... MOGn
    list all or the specified entries from the user's database of own MOGUL
    contributions
*** ozmake --mogul=export
    create all necessary MOGUL entries for download by the MOGUL librarian
** ozmake --config=(put|delete|list)
   the possible values were renamed to be similar to those for --mogul
** --publishdir is no longer supported, instead we have
   --moguldir    --mogulurl
   --moguldbdir  --moguldburl
   --mogulpkgdir --mogulpkgurl
   --moguldocdir --moguldocurl
** makefiles support the `tar' feature which should be a file extension
   or list of such taken from ['tgz' 'tar.gz' 'tar.Z'].  This is to
   support older contributions which cannot easily be converted to
   ozmake but which are nonetheless distributed in the form of
   tarballs.  You can write a makefile.oz for them and use this
   makefile only to generate the corresponding mogul entry:
      ozmake --mogul=put
   then export your updated mogul database explicitly
      ozmake --mogul=export

* version 0.72
** ozmake --config=... now permits to manage predefined defaults
   defaults can always be explicitly overriden on the command line
   ozmake --config=set --FEAT1=VAL1 --FEAT2=VAL2 ...
     saves the given defaults for those features (ignoring features
     for which defaults cannot be set)
   ozmake --config=unset FEAT1 FEAT2 ...
     removes defaults for these features
   ozmake --config=list
     lists the current defaults
** option --exe controls the name and platform of installed executables
   the convention on Windows is that executables have an .exe extension
   while on Unix there is normally no extension.
   --exe=default only installs executables using the platform's convention
   --exe=yes only installs executables with .exe extension
   --exe=no only installs executables without extension
   --exe=both installs both
   --exe=multi installs both, but the .exe one is linked for Windows
   while the no extension one is linked for Unix
** additional features supported in makefile.oz
   requires   : [ ... ] for dependencies on other packages
   categories : [ ... ] for MOGUL classification
   version    : ... a version number e.g. "2" or "3.2.7"
** --freshen upgrades only if necessary, and does not report an
   error if it is not necessary to upgrade
** ozmake --extract will exceptionally write a makefile.oz if none
   was included in the package.  This is for compatibility with
   packages created with earlier versions of ozmake.

* version 0.71
** ozmake --extract: default directory changed from current directory
   to subdirectory with name derived from the package mogul id
** makefiles are now textually included in packages
   the preprocessed makefile is now called MAKEPKG.oz and is
   only used when installing from a package file when not explitly
   disabled by the user with --nousemakepkg

* version 0.7n
** start recording changes between versions
** OZLOAD properly passed to sub ozc processes
** fixed date handling: unfortunately, this is an incompatible change
   all recorded package dates prior to this fix, where incorrect

* previous history not recorded
